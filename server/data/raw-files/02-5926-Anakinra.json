Despite oxygen supplementation and cPAP, however, due to rapid respiratory deterioration in the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the patient was eventually admitted to the ICU and required intubation on February 28. During his stay in the ICU, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and anakinra was maintained, while piperacillin-tazobactam and linezolid were started in place of levofloxacin. In addition, he required vasopressor support with noradrenaline.

A plain X-ray film and a CT scan showed massive free air in the abdominal cavity, distension of the large bowel, and perforation of the ascending colon. In addition, pulmonary embolism was detected. The patient underwent emergent laparotomy: intraoperative findings included profuse amount of free air, distension of the entire abdominal colon, and a minimal perforation on the anterolateral aspect of the distended cecum. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular weight heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and fluconazole were started immediately after surgery.  chest X-ray showed resolution of bilateral interstitial pneumonia.

The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal on March 23 tested positive, and the patient was encouraged to maintain home quarantine for at least 14 days.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5926,8342,8711,8745,8782,11370]},{"id":6331,"regimens":[{"id":12227,"duration":{"id":6225,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9641,"answer":"To

Clinical course seemed favorable in three of our patients, but one of them deteriorated after 10 days of hospitalization, probably due to an acute form of graft dysfunction triggered both by COVID-19 and a nosocomial bacterial infection, and eventually died. Although short-term prognosis could be considered benign in the majority of our patients, we should carefully monitor these individuals in order to detect early sign of clinical deterioration and graft dysfunction in the next few months.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Series","number_of_patients":4,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Non‐specific interstitial pneumonia status post lung transplant on prednisone, tacrolimus and azathioprine.

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo. En todos los casos la radiografía de tórax era patológica con infiltrado unilateral o bilateral. La procalcitonina demostró no ser suficientemente sensible para detectar la infección neumocócica. La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida. Los clínicos deben de ser conscientes de la posible asociación de SARS-CoV-2 y neumococo para evitar errores diagnósticos y retrasos en el tratamiento antibiótico.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Coinfección; Diagnosis; Diagnóstico; S. pneumoniae; Tratamiento; Treatment; co-infection.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"Yes","age":"81-89 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Ischemic Heart Disease\r\nAortic Stenosis","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including diabetes, hypertension (treated with ARBs), Ischemic heart disease, aortic stenosis, and chronic kidney disease.

Some of them develop a systemic hyperinflammatory state produced by the massive release of inflammatory agents, known as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Inhibition of IL-1 by Anakinra (ANK) is a potential life-saving therapy for severe CSS cases. We propose a rationale for the use of subcutaneous ANK and review our initial experience in a small cohort of severe COVID-19 CSS patients.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients developing ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and exhibiting signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >1000 ng/mL and/or d-dimers > 1.5 μg/mL, plus IL-6 < 40 mg/mL) that received ANK. For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group. Favorable outcome was achieved in 55.6% and 88.9% of the ANK and TCZ cohorts, respectively (p = 0.281). Two patients that failed to respond to TCZ improved after ANK treatment. Aminotransferase levels significantly increased between day 1 and day 7 (p = 0.004) in the TCZ group. Mortality was the same in both groups (11%). There were not any opportunistic infection in the groups nor other adverse effects attributable to treatment.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Overall, 55.6% of COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients treated with ANK exhibited favorable outcome, not inferior to a TCZ treated matched cohort.

Some of them develop a systemic hyperinflammatory state produced by the massive release of inflammatory agents, known as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Inhibition of IL-1 by Anakinra (ANK) is a potential life-saving therapy for severe CSS cases. We propose a rationale for the use of subcutaneous ANK and review our initial experience in a small cohort of severe COVID-19 CSS patients.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients developing ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and exhibiting signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >1000 ng/mL and/or d-dimers > 1.5 μg/mL, plus IL-6 < 40 mg/mL) that received ANK. For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group. Favorable outcome was achieved in 55.6% and 88.9% of the ANK and TCZ cohorts, respectively (p = 0.281). Two patients that failed to respond to TCZ improved after ANK treatment. Aminotransferase levels significantly increased between day 1 and day 7 (p = 0.004) in the TCZ group. Mortality was the same in both groups (11%). There were not any opportunistic infection in the groups nor other adverse effects attributable to treatment.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Overall, 55.6% of COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients treated with ANK exhibited favorable outcome, not inferior to a TCZ treated matched cohort.
