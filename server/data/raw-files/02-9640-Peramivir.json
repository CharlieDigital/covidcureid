of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China.

After contacting a public health center on January 25, he was isolated in a negative pressure room at Myongji Hospital and confirmed to have COVID-19 on January 26.\r\n\r\nAt that time the initial confirmation of COVID-19 was made by pan-coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction assay and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons using a throat swab.\r\n\r\nThe index patient transmitted the virus to his friend (patient A) at a restaurant on the 1st day of the symptoms. And then patient A (confirmed on January 30, 2020) transmitted COVID-19 to his spouse and son (confirmed on January 31, 2020), and a church colleague (confirmed on February 6, 2020). Those were the first cases of tertiary transmission of COVID-19 outside China.\r\n\r\nThe index patient was a clothing worker at the Wuhan Fashion Center, with a height of 193 cm and weight of 96 kg (body mass index, 25.7), and had no major illness. He denied any smoking and drinking history.\r\n\r\nOn admission day, he had no respiratory symptoms and blood pressure of 152/93 mmHg, pulse rate of 73 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.0°C. On physical examination, no pharyngeal injection, clear lung sounds, and no haziness on chest X-ray were observed. Tests for Leptospira, Hantan virus, Tsutsugamushi, Malaria, M tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Ag/Ab, and venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test were all negative.\r\n\r\nHe developed fever and dry cough on days 5 and 7 of illness, respectively, but he had no serious respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, productive sputum or chest pain. Small consolidation in right upper lobe and ground-glass opacities in both lower lobes were observed on high-resolution computed tomography scan.\r\n\r\nThe initial viral load could not be measured because real-time PCR was not available when the patient was diagnosed. So we measured viral loads using quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR since Jan. 31, 2020. Viral RNA was extracted from the sputum using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All quantitative real-time PCR amplifications were performed using Quantstudio 1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and PowerCheck™ SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time PCR kit (KogeneBiotech, Seoul, Korea).\r\n\r\nThere were some reports about lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) for the treatment of COVID-19.1\r\nLopinavir/ritonavir was started from the hospital day 8 (day 10 of illness); 2 tablets (lopinavir 200 mg/ritonavir 50 mg) were given per oral bid. Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).  It is possible that the decreased load of SARS-CoV-2 resulted from the natural course of the healing process rather than administration of lopinavir/ritonavir, or both. Therefore, more data need to be collected to figure out the direct effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on treatment with COVID-19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: No\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that symptoms were noted to begin improving: 11\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that full resolution of symptoms was noted: 18\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that patient was discharged if admitted: 19\r\n\r\nJustification for timing of resolution: Admitted on Jan 25, 2020. Lopinavir/ritonavir started on Feb 1, 2020. Discharged on Feb 10, 2020.  Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6675,8711,8783,9640,10547]},{"id":6236,"regimens":[{"id":11950,"duration":{"id":5948,"approximate_duration":"1day","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":11339,"name":"Convalescent plasma","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11339","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9133,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11950},{"id":9134,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11950}],"created":"2020-10-09T22:40:11.522140Z","updated":"2020-12-17T19:02:18.515776Z","dose":"200ml","frequency":"QD","route":"IV","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6236},{"id":11951,"duration":{"id":5949,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":10942,"name":"Umifenovir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10942","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9135,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11951},{"id":9136,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11951}],"created":"2020-10-09T22:40:11.529692Z","updated":"2020-12-17T19:02:18.556599Z","dose":"0.2g","frequency":"Q8H","route":"PO","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6236},{"id":11952,"duration":{"id":5950,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9463,"name":"Oseltamivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9463","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9137,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11952},{"id":9138,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11952}],"created":"2020-10-09T22:40:11.535764Z","updated":"2020-12-17T19:02:18.527677Z","dose":"75mg","frequency":"BID","route":"PO","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6236},{"id":11953,"duration":{"id":5951,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9640,"name":"Peramivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9640","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9139,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11953},{"id":9140,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11953}],"created":"2020-10-09T22:40:11.542082Z","updated":"2020-12-17T19:02:18.533025Z","dose":"0.3g","frequency":"QD","route":"IV","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6236}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8199,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6236},{"id":8200,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6236},{"id":8201,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6236}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13943,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6236},{"id":13944,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6236},{"id":13945,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6236}],"author_username":"Belinda Nhundu","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4276,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6236}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":417,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-10-09T22:37:46.898730Z","updated":"2020-12-17T19:02:18.507627Z","title":"Effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19 patients.Case 9.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32253318,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.2004168117","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32253318/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Duan K\r\nLiu B\r\nLi C\r\net.al.","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","abstract":"Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Series","number_of_patients":10,"article_patient_number":"9","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[11339,9463,9640,10942]},{"id":6376,"regimens":[{"id":12349,"duration":{"id":6348,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9857,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12349},{"id":9858,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":12349}],"created":"2020-10-27T22:00:55.774579Z","updated":"2020-10-27T22:20:58.446991Z","dose":"400mg","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6376},{"id":12350,"duration":{"id":6349,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9640,"name":"Peramivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9640","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9859,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12350},{"id":9860,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":12350}],"created":"2020-10-27T22:00:55.782169Z","updated":"2020-10-27T22:20:58.452941Z","dose":"100mg","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6376}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14291,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6376},{"id":14292,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6376},{"id":14293,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6376}],"author_username":"Belinda Nhundu","resistant_drugs":[{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine"},{"id":9640,"name":"Peramivir"}],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4467,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6376}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":471,"answer":"Black or African American","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-10-27T21:59:19.878397Z","updated":"2020-10-27T22:20:58.439379Z","title":"Encephalopathy and Encephalitis Associated with Cerebrospinal Fluid Cytokine Alterations and Coronavirus Disease, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2020.Case 1.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32487282,"doi":"10.3201/eid2609.202122","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32487282/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Benameur K\r\nAgarwal A\r\nAuld SC\r\nButters MP\r\nWebster AS\r\nOzturk T\r\nHowell JC\r\nBassit LC\r\nVelasquez A\r\nSchinazi RF\r\nMullins ME\r\nHu WT","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"Emerging infectious diseases","abstract":"There are few detailed investigations of neurologic complications in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

These changes provide evidence of CSF periinfectious/postinfectious inflammatory changes during coronavirus disease with neurologic complications.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Series","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Pulmonary embolus","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed nonenhancing cerebral edema and diffusion weighted imaging abnormalities predominantly involving the right cerebral hemisphere, as well as brain herniation.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Brain MRI appearance was most consistent with encephalitis and myelitis, with superimposed hypoxic ischemic changes in a Covid 19 patient.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342,9640]},{"id":6571,"regimens":[{"id":12984,"duration":{"id":6910,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9640,"name":"Peramivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9640","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11141,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12984},{"id":11142,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":12984}],"created":"2020-11-25T19:28:44.862239Z","updated":"2020-11-27T18:15:44.438042Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6571},{"id":12985,"duration":{"id":6911,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9077,"name":"Methylprednisolone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9077","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11143,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12985},{"id":11144,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":12985}],"created":"2020-11-25T19:29:08.633224Z","updated":"2020-11-27T18:15:44.444681Z","dose":"80mg","frequency":"QD","route":"IV","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6571}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14811,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6571},{"id":14812,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6571}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4736,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6571}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":517,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-11-25T19:27:45.633262Z","updated":"2020-11-27T18:15:44.429805Z","title":"Alveolar macrophage dysfunction and cytokine storm in the pathogenesis of two severe COVID-19 patients.

We report the fundamental pathological investigation in the lungs and other organs of fatal cases for the mechanistic understanding of severe COVID-19 and the development of specific therapy in these cases.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              The autopsy and pathological investigations of specimens were performed on bodies of two deceased cases with COVID-19. Gross anatomy and histological investigation by Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained were reviewed on each patient. Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining and Masson staining were performed for the examinations of mucus, fibrin and collagen fiber in lung tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on the slides of lung tissues from two patients. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Flow cytometry analyses were performed to detect the direct binding of S protein and the expression of ACE2 on the cell surface of macrophages.          \r\n        Findings:      \r\n              The main pathological features in lungs included extensive impairment of type I alveolar epithelial cells and atypical hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells, with formation of hyaline membrane, focal hemorrhage, exudation and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary consolidation. The mucous plug with fibrinous exudate in the alveoli and the dysfunction of alveolar macrophages were characteristic abnormalities. The type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages in alveoli and pulmonary hilum lymphoid tissue were infected by SARS-CoV-2. S protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly bound to the macrophage via the S-protein-ACE2 interaction.          \r\n        Interpretation:      \r\n              Infection of alveolar macrophage by SARS-CoV-2 might be drivers of the \"cytokine storm\", which might result in damages in pulmonary tissues, heart and lung, and lead to the failure of multiple organs .          \r\n        Funding:      \r\n              Shanghai Guangci Translational Medical Research Development Foundation, Shanghai, China.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Alveolar macrophage; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Pathology; SARS-CoV-2.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"None","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory Tract Infection","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Nasal cannular oxygenation and mask\r\nCause of death: Respiratory failure, Heart failure","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[9077,9640]}]
