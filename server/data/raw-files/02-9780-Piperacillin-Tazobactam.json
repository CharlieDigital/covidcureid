He has been living in Chengdu, Sichuan province, for a long time. However, his mother had traveled to Wuhan a week ago and was diagnosed with the new coronavirus after she got back home. He has referred to the emergency department of our institution on 2 February 2020. General physical examination showed that moist rales were audible over both lungs, and the body temperature was 36.7C, and other results were unremarkable. The laboratory tests showed that white blood cell count kept in the normal range (5.11  109/l), and the differential count showed decreased lymphocyte (16.8%, normal range 20–50%) and increased C-reactive protein (22.50 mg/l; normal\r\nrange <5 mg/l). Chest computed tomography (CT) (2 February 2020) showed that there were ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both in bilateral lungs (Figure 1A). Considering the contact history with his mother and the CT features, a real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient’s throat swab was performed, and the patient was confirmed with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving 3 days of treatment with an antiviral (Veletonavir, [also known as Lopinavir-Ritonavir]), and anti-inflammatory (Methylprednisolone), the patient’s cough was relieved, and repeated chest CT (5 February 2020) showed the extent and density of lesions were significantly decreased (Figure 1B). Laboratory tests, however, showed that lymphocytes were still reduced, and erythrocyte sedimentation\r\nrate was increased. On 6 February 2020, the patient began to have a fever (body temperature 38.6C) then additional antibiotics (Piperacillin–tazobactam) was given. Unfortunately, 2 days later, the patient’s body temperature reached a maximum of 39.0C, accompanied by a paroxysmal cough, and the whole body’s skin was flushing. CT images (9 February 2020) manifested as extensive groundglass opacities, consolidation in bilateral lungs. Oddly, compared with CT images of the last two times (Figure 1C), all the lesions were found in different locations (Figure 1D). On 11 February 2020, he received a real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the throat swab again, and the results were still positive.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8783,9077,9780]},{"id":5398,"regimens":[{"id":10043,"duration":{"id":4108,"approximate_duration":"6 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8782,"name":"Lopinavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8782","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5950,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10043},{"id":5951,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10043}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:52.152071Z","updated":"2020-05-06T13:30:09.412317Z","dose":"400 mg","frequency":"BID","route":"Oral","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5398},{"id":10227,"duration":{"id":4109,"approximate_duration":"6 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":9780,"name":"Piperacillin-Tazobactam","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9780","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5952,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10227},{"id":5953,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10227}],"created":"2020-05-04T23:41:04.641504Z","updated":"2020-05-06T13:30:09.419182Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5398}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7141,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5398},{"id":7142,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5398},{"id":7143,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5398}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":11762,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5398},{"id":11893,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5398},{"id":11894,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5398}],"author_username":"CURE ID Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3215,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5398}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:52.138200Z","updated":"2020-05-06T13:30:09.403125Z","title":"2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia: Serial Computed Tomography Findings.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32100486,"doi":"10.3348/kjr.2020.0112","article_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32100486","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Wei J, Xu H, Xiong J, Shen Q, Fan B, Ye C, Dong W, Hu F","article_author_email":"26171381@qq.com","journal":"Korean journal of radiology","abstract":"From December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia (formerly known as the 2019 novel Coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) broke out in Wuhan, China.

The patient was physically healthy before and had no underlying diseases. She did not travel to Wuhan city and denied any contact with patients with COVID-19 infection. \r\n\r\nAt admission, her body temperature was elevated to 38.9°C. Laboratory examinations showed normal leukocyte (4170/μL), neutrophils (59.6%), and lymphocytes (30.9%). There was an increase in hematocrit (0.456) and glucose (7.3 mmol/L) levels. The initial chest radiograph, taken 3-days\r\nafter fever onset, was normal in both lungs (Fig. 1A). On the same day, unenhanced chest CT showed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the subpleural area of the right lower lobe (Fig. 1B), and the left lung was normal. She was given antibiotics for symptomatic treatment.\r\n\r\nAt first, the patient did not show any respiratory symptoms, however, on day 6 after fever onset, she began coughing. A follow-up chest CT revealed an increased density of GGOs in the right lower lobe, which then progressed into consolidations with perilobular thickening. Moreover, multifocal peripheral patchy areas of nodular consolidations and GGO lesions were newly developed in the subpleural\r\nareas of the both lower lobes (Fig. 1C-E). Laboratory examination showed decreased leukocyte (3390/μL) and eosinophils (0.0%); normal neutrophils (67.4%) and lymphocytes (23.7%); and increased C-reactive protein (8.00 mg/L). The influenza A antigen screening was negative. Finally, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by realtime reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRTPCR) amplification of the viral DNA from a sputum sample. \r\n\r\nThe patient was isolated and treated with antiviral drug (lopinavir: 200 mg/capsule, 2 capsules each time, twice a day) and antibiotics (tabaxin [piperacillin + tazobactam]). After 6 days of treatment, the temperature of the patient dropped to normal and the symptoms disappeared. On day 12, a repeat rRT-PCR was negative and the patient was discharged.

Mounting evidence suggests that COVID-19 is fueled by a maladaptive host inflammatory response that involves excessive activation of innate immune pathways. While a “cytokine storm” involving IL-6 and other cytokines has been documented, complement C3 activation has been implicated as an initial effector mechanism that exacerbates lung injury in preclinical models of SARS-CoV infection. C3-targeted intervention may provide broader therapeutic control of complement-mediated inflammatory damage in COVID-19 patients.

On returning home, the patient had contact with her parents, who had recently arrived from the city of Brasilia, Brazil, with symptoms of fever and dry cough. After 5 days of contact, she experienced the first symptoms of the disease, with weakness, dry cough, dyspnea, and an episode of hemoptysis. On day 8 post-delivery (March 28), the patient was admitted to the hospital with severe dyspnea.

After administration of SC tocilizumab, fever disappeared, and lung function progressively improved, with reduction of oxygen support and positioning of nasal oxygen flow with 4 l/min.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342,9780,10776]},{"id":6022,"regimens":[{"id":11330,"duration":{"id":5385,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7831,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11330},{"id":7832,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11330}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:25:27.920526Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.243313Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6022},{"id":11331,"duration":{"id":5386,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7833,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11331},{"id":7834,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11331}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:25:27.928038Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.249908Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6022},{"id":11332,"duration":{"id":5387,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7835,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11332},{"id":7836,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11332}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:25:27.934280Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.255847Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6022},{"id":11333,"duration":{"id":5388,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9780,"name":"Piperacillin-Tazobactam","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9780","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7837,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11333},{"id":7838,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11333}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:25:27.940347Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.261556Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6022}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13449,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6022},{"id":13450,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6022},{"id":13451,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6022}],"author_username":"Reema Charles","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3988,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6022},{"id":3989,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":6022}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"},{"id":373,"name":"Tuberculosis"}],"races":[{"id":290,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:22:10.404149Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.234728Z","title":"Tuberculosis, COVID-19 and migrants: Preliminary analysis of deaths occurring in 69 patients from two cohorts.

The aim of this study is to describe a group of patients who died with TB (active disease or sequelae) and COVID-19 in two cohorts. Data from 49 consecutive cases in 8 countries (cohort A) and 20 hospitalised patients with TB and COVID-19 (cohort B) were analysed and patients who died were described. Demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB and COVID-19 mortality. Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B. Migrants: (1) were younger than natives; in cohort A the median (IQR) age was 40 (27-49) VS. 66 (46-70) years, whereas in cohort B 37 (27-46) VS. 48 (47-60) years; (2) had a lower mortality rate than natives (1/43, 2.3% versus 7/26, 26.9%; p-value: 0.002); (3) had fewer co-morbidities than natives (23/43, 53.5% versus 5/26-19.2%) natives; p-value: 0.005). The study findings show that: (1) mortality is likely to occur in elderly patients with co-morbidities; (2) TB might not be a major determinant of mortality and (3) migrants had lower mortality, probably because of their younger age and lower number of co-morbidities. However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.          \r\n

December 2019, in Wuhan, China. As of today, 3 April 2020, 972,640 people affected and 50,325 people died from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2. There is not any standard treatment for coronavirus infection 2019; however, there are promising data for hydroxychloroquine and some anti-retroviral drugs. Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) pathway is an important target for the cancer immunotherapy. However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections. Thus, blockade of this pathway may lead to an anti-viral effect and decrease viral load. Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma. In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding. We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.

On HD #3, his D-dimer was > 10,000 ng/mL (from 501 ng/mL on admission). A heparin infusion was started empirically and titrated to an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.5 IU/mL. With the exception of four anti-Xa levels that were slightly supratherapeutic (0.55–0.73 IU/mL), the level remained within the target range. On HD #5, he was enrolled in a clinical trial and was given sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody, or placebo. His subsequent hospital course was complicated by hypotension with increasing vasopressor requirements and acute kidney injury necessitating initiation of dialysis on HD #10. On HD #13, neurocritical care was consulted due to persistent encephalopathy and concern for absent brainstem reflexes.Non-contrast head CT (NCHCT) demonstrated multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, mass effect, and evidence of global anoxic injury, cerebral edema, and downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils. Given his grave prognosis, the family decided to make the patient DNR, and the patient died on HD #13.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6675,8342,9780,11304,11121]},{"id":6198,"regimens":[{"id":11840,"duration":{"id":5838,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9780,"name":"Piperacillin-Tazobactam","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9780","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8924,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11840},{"id":8925,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11840}],"created":"2020-10-07T13:49:54.524865Z","updated":"2020-10-16T14:17:26.251607Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6198},{"id":11841,"duration":{"id":5839,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8926,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11841},{"id":8927,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11841}],"created":"2020-10-07T13:49:54.532511Z","updated":"2020-10-16T14:17:26.258027Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6198}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8137,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6198},{"id":8138,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6198}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13847,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6198},{"id":13848,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6198},{"id":13851,"answer":"Culture","answer_other":"","report":6198}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4226,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6198},{"id":4227,"answer":"Unusual disease presentation","answer_other":"","report":6198}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-10-07T13:43:58.928261Z","updated":"2020-10-16T14:17:26.243719Z","title":"Clinicopathologic Aspects of a Papulovesicular Eruption in a Patient With COVID-19.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32579185,"doi":"10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.1966","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32579185/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Trellu LT\r\nKaya G\r\nAlberto C\r\nCalame A\r\nMcKee T\r\nCalmy A","article_author_email":"laurence.trellu@hcuge.ch","journal":"JAMA Dermatology","abstract":"There are reports of various skin findings associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 where a woman  in her 40s with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14-day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan.

populations emphasized a mild course of disease with severe cases disproportionately affecting infant and comorbid pediatric patients. After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by a SARS-CoV-2-positive female child who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal dysfunction and fluid-refractory hypotension requiring vasopressors and PICU admission.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Child; Coronavirus; Enoxaparin; Pediatric;

pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly, with many cases confirmed in multiple countries. Usually, after viral pneumonia were clinical cured, the pulmonary lesions of majority patients will gradually be absorbed to complete dissipation, very few severe patients may retain pulmonary interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (1-3). In this case, we described one unique COVID-19 patient, the symptoms were: dry cough, fatigue, poor appetite and subjective fever, moreover, the patient was a non-smoker, had no pulmonary bullous, no history of tuberculosis, and also no hypertension or diabetes. The patient received antiviral therapy, antibacterial therapy, recombinant human interferon-α2a, vitamin C and oxygen inhalation. After two weeks of treatment and observation, the patient was clinical cured and discharged.

Response to first-line therapies was delayed as it took up to 13 days after initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose dexamethasone to observe an increase in platelet count. COVID-19 may be associated with late presenting severe ITP. Such ITP may also be relatively resistant to first-line agents. Hematological manifestations of COVID-19, such as the ones associated with life-threatening bleeding, must be recognized.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Bleeding; COVID-19; Corticosteroids; Immunoglobulin; Thrombocytopenia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient deteriorated","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Canada","country_treated":"Canada","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Dyslipidemia","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including hyper tension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes.

The clinical and laboratory data for these patients were extracted.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              One patient in the 10-day group received RDV for only 5 days because of nausea and elevated liver transaminases. No patient had respiratory comorbidity. Seven patients had bilateral lesions and three had unilateral lesions on imaging. All patients had received other medications for COVID-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, before administration of RDV. Five patients required supplemental oxygen and one required mechanical ventilation. All patients showed clinical and laboratory evidence of improvement. Half of the patients developed elevated liver transaminases and three had nausea. There were no adverse events exceeding grade 2.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              Our experience indicates that RDV could be a therapeutic option for COVID-19.

\r\n            COVID-19 is a respiratory illness due to novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), described in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and rapidly evolved into a pandemic. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract can also be involved.    \r\n          Case presentation:        \r\n            A 44-year-old man was hospitalised for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A rapid recovery of respiratory and general symptoms was observed after 1 week of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine and broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam plus teicoplanin). No GI symptoms were reported during hospitalisation, but a lung contrast-enhancement CT (CE-CT) excluding thromboembolism showed, as collateral finding, intraperitoneal free bubbles not present on a previous CT examination; the subsequent abdominal CE-CT described pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) involving the caecum and the right colon. Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was started, and the 2-week follow-up CT showed the complete resolution of PI.    \r\n          Discussion:        \r\n            The pathogenesis of PI is poorly understood. PI involving the caecum and right colon has been described for HIV and Cytomegalovirus infections, but, to our best knowledge, never before in COVID-19. We hypothesise a multifactorial aetiopathogenesis for PI, with a possible role of the bowel wall damage and microbiota impairment due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we suggest a conservative management in the absence of symptoms.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            bacterial overgrowth; clinical decision making; colonic diseases; colonic microflora; infectious
