After surgery he was seizure free with 1500 mg/day levetiracetam for five months. He also received anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and a maintenance dose of 20 mg/day prednisone for nephrosis. A week before admission he felt bulging in his skin flap. Just after arrival to the hospital, he had a focal aware seizure that last for a few minutes before administration of 7.5 mg diazopam. Head CT showered severe brain swelling go the right temporal lobe. Chest CT revealed ground-glass opacities. Anti-epileptic and anticoagulation therapies were strengthened to 2000 mg/day levetiracetam and 3/5 mg/day warfarin, which thus far, has prevented further seizures.

ventilation. While increased sputum secretion could cause airway obstruction during mechanical ventilation, there are few reported cases in the literature. We report a case of a 65-year-old man with diabetes and severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, nafamostat, and prone positioning. Initially, mechanical ventilation consisted of a heat moisture exchanger, endotracheal tube aspiration, and subglottic secretion drainage using a closed suction system. However, endotracheal tube impaction by highly viscous sputum occurred during this mechanical ventilation system. Replacing the endotracheal tube, the use of a humidifier instead of a heat moisture exchanger, and prone positioning contributed to the patient being weaned off mechanical ventilation. Although anti-aerosol measures are important for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, attention should be given to potential endotracheal tube impaction during mechanical ventilation.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  coronavirus 2019 (covid-19); coronavirus disease 2019; covid-19 respiratory failure high altitude pulmonary edema high flow nasal cannula acute respiratory distress syndrome; invasive mechanical ventilation; key words corona; sars cov-2; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2); tube impaction.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Continuation of mechanical ventilation proved difficult after endotracheal tube impaction with highly viscous sputum.

All patients had received other medications for COVID-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, before administration of RDV.
