On January 17, 2020, the patient presented a feeling of general malaise and coldness. On January 19, she had fever with body temperature of 37.3 °C and experienced diarrhea and vomiting. She started to receive intravenous injection of cefotaxime in community clinic and took oral Jinyebaidu granules (another Chinese traditional patent medicine) and oseltamivir\r\n(75 mg, twice a day) for 4 days. She had persistent severe fever with body temperature from 37.6 °C to\r\n38.3 °C for four days. On January 23, her chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple patchy ground glass opacity and consolidation shadow in bilateral lung and sub-pleural regions.  She was highly suspected with COVID-19.  Oral moxifloxacin and arbidol were prescribed, and she continued to take Jinyebaidu granules and oseltamivir. On January 24, her body temperature reached 39.9 °C and experienced severe fatigue, diarrhea, and breathlessness despite continuous treatments of the above drugs. She felt better after intravenous injection of immunoglobin (IVIG, 5 g per day) and dexamethasone (5 mg, once to twice a day). However, the patient experienced recurrent fever (body temperature of 39 °C) and breathlessness, and her blood oxygen saturation fluctuated from 90% to 95% at the night of January 27. On January 28, the second chest CT scan indicated that her pneumonia aggravated for the past 5 days (Fig. 1B). A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was obtained and sent for detection of 2019-nCoV. Although the patient’s 2019-nCoV test was negative (Table 1), she was diagnosed of COVID-19 in accordance with her symptoms and chest CT display. On the same day, she was confined into an isolation ward and started to take oral SHL (twice a day, 20 mL once). On the next day, SHL administration increased to three times a day (20 mL once) without using any other drugs. From January 29 to 31, the patient’s symptoms resolved with body temperature decreasing from 37.3 °C to 36.5 °C and without vomiting and diarrhea. The patient gradually felt strong except for slight cough. After February 6, the patient’s symptoms disappeared, and her third chest CT scan (Fig. 1C) showed significant absorption of bilateral ground glass opacity compared with the previous ones.\r\n\r\nEver on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: No","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[7230,8412,9197,11307,10942]},{"id":5457,"regimens":[{"id":10212,"duration":{"id":4070,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":11307,"name":"Shuanghuanglian","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11307","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5727,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10212},{"id":5919,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10212}],"created":"2020-05-01T11:54:08.622117Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:55:45.400758Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5457},{"id":10213,"duration":{"id":4071,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":11318,"name":"Jinyebaidu","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11318","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5728,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10213},{"id":5729,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10213}],"created":"2020-05-01T11:54:08.628641Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:55:45.407040Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5457},{"id":10214,"duration":{"id":4072,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9463,"name":"Oseltamivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9463","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5730,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10214},{"id":5731,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10214}],"created":"2020-05-01T11:54:08.634110Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:55:45.412491Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5457},{"id":10215,"duration":{"id":4073,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9197,"name":"Moxifloxacin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9197","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5732,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10215},{"id":5733,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10215}],"created":"2020-05-01T11:54:08.639465Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:55:45.418182Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5457},{"id":10216,"duration":{"id":4074,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":10942,"name":"Umifenovir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10942","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5734,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10216},{"id":5735,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10216}],"created":"2020-05-01T11:54:08.644664Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:55:45.449874Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5457}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7071,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5457},{"id":7072,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5457}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":11823,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5457},{"id":11824,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5457}],"author_username":"CURE ID Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"Armenian","why_new_way":[{"id":3270,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5457}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-04-30T23:18:31.687584Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:55:45.392406Z","title":"Combination of western medicine and Chinese traditional patent medicine in treating a family case of COVID-19 in Wuhan.
