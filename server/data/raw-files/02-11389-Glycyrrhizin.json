Studies show clear person-to-person transmission. The average incubation period is 2-14 days, and mostly 3-7 days. However, in some patients, this period may be longer. Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 where a 47-year-old woman with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14-day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan. Almost at the same time, her father and sister were diagnosed with COVID-19. The results suggest that the long-term use of glucocorticoids might cause atypical infections, a long incubation period, and extra transmission of COVID-19.\r\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
