The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

Similarly, the lung injury observed in severe COVID-19 cases appears to be related to a massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The selective JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has shown promising results in the context of GVHD, and different trials are currently underway in patients with severe COVID-19; nevertheless, no clinical observation of safety or efficacy of treatment with ruxolitinib in this context has been published yet. We describe a first case of severe COVID-19 developed after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with a concomitant chronic GVHD (cGVHD), in which a treatment with ruxolitinib was administered with good tolerance and positive outcome.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome); COVID-19; chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD); hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT); ruxolitinib.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":null,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"1 year ago underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched sibling brother for high-risk, triple-negative (JAK2, MPL, CALR) myelofibrosis, latent tuberculosis infection","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"He has been receiving ruxolitinib 5 mg bid (offlabel use) for a steroid-refractory, moderate cGVHD with involvement of skin and mouth, achieving a complete response at the time of office visit.\r\nHe was then discharged with a follow-up appointment scheduled 3 months later, confirming ruxolitinib treatment up to the next visit.\r\nTwo weeks later, he presented at the emergency room complaining of fatigue, dry cough, and mild dyspnea.\r\n At hospital admission, ruxolitinib was discontinued, assuming a possible deleterious immunosuppressive activity and delayed viral clearance in a patient with an active viral infection, as previously reported.\r\nThe ongoing therapy with isoniazid and valacyclovir was continued.
