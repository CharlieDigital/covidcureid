He reported no history of travel through an area with confirmed COVID-19 cases or contact with sick persons. After excluding malaria and dengue, which are common causative agents of acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) in Thailand, chest radiography was performed according to the patient triage protocol of our institute for AUFI during the COVID-19 outbreak. Chest radiography revealed findings compatible with pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal, throat, and sputum samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. The preadmission diagnosis of COVID-19 in this patient enabled appropriate management and isolation to prevent nosocomial transmission. Fever and nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results in early COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from tropical infectious diseases, especially when respiratory signs and symptoms are absent. This fact necessitates vigilant awareness in clinical investigation, management, and infection control, especially in tropical resource-limited settings.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Thailand","country_treated":"Thailand","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"CXR on day 11 of illness - increased patchy opacity at the RLL field, with a cavitary-like lesion in the same area - Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was added for possible lung abscess. \r\nChest radiography on day 14 of illness revealed decreasing patchy opacity in the RLL.\r\nOn the follow-up at 1 month after the onset of disease, he was without complaints, with almost normal CXR findings.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6772,11165,11364]}]
