Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nTo describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\r\nStudy Design\r\n\r\nWe describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nAmong 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"30 3/7 weeks’ gestation","pregnant":true,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"A 25- to 29-year-old previously healthy gravida at 30 3/7 weeks’ gestation was seen in the outpatient antenatal clinic the day before admission with a complaint of sore throat and rhinorrhea with dry cough, but she was afebrile and did not have dyspnea. She was admitted the next day after becoming febrile (39°C) and experiencing shortness of breath and was normotensive (125/80 mm Hg). On the day of admission, chest CT had features of viral pneumonia, laboratory values were significant for lymphopenia and pancytopenia, and antepartum testing for fetal well-being was reassuring. The SARS-CoV-2 testing was done, but her test results were not positive until the day of death. Nonetheless, she was initiated on oseltamivir, azithromycin, and ceftazidime at the time of admission. She experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 24 hours later and was transferred to the ICU and intubated; linezolid and amantadine were added. Later that evening, onset of spontaneous labor accompanied persistent oxygen desaturations (SaO2 88% on ventilator support), with spontaneous vaginal delivery of an intrauterine fetal death (IUFD, stillbirth) the following morning. With persistent postpartum ARDS (SaO2 85%–90% on maximal ventilator support), meropenem, vancomycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir were added.

Despite oxygen supplementation and cPAP, however, due to rapid respiratory deterioration in the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the patient was eventually admitted to the ICU and required intubation on February 28. During his stay in the ICU, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and anakinra was maintained, while piperacillin-tazobactam and linezolid were started in place of levofloxacin. In addition, he required vasopressor support with noradrenaline. His clinical conditions progressively improved and, after discontinuing antibiotics on March 3 and invasive mechanical ventilation on March 4, the patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit on March 5.\r\n\r\nOn March 8, after 2 days of diarrhea, the patient complained of abdominal pain and marked distension; at clinical examination, signs of peritoneal irritation were detected. A plain X-ray film and a CT scan showed massive free air in the abdominal cavity, distension of the large bowel, and perforation of the ascending colon. In addition, pulmonary embolism was detected. The patient underwent emergent laparotomy: intraoperative findings included profuse amount of free air, distension of the entire abdominal colon, and a minimal perforation on the anterolateral aspect of the distended cecum. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular weight heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and fluconazole were started immediately after surgery.  chest X-ray showed resolution of bilateral interstitial pneumonia.

The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal on March 23 tested positive, and the patient was encouraged to maintain home quarantine for at least 14 days.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5926,8342,8711,8745,8782,11370]},{"id":6220,"regimens":[{"id":11897,"duration":{"id":5895,"approximate_duration":"1day","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":11339,"name":"Convalescent

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been successively reported globally. Studies show clear person-to-person transmission. The average incubation period is 2-14 days, and mostly 3-7 days. However, in some patients, this period may be longer. Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 where a woman  in her 40s with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14-day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan. Almost at the same time, her father and sister were diagnosed with COVID-19. The results suggest that the long-term use of glucocorticoids might cause atypical infections, a long incubation period, and extra transmission of

The virus is highly infectious. Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3\r\n+\r\n T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients. And the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients is challenged by the immunosuppressive state of these patients under chemotherapy or surgery.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Cancer; Coronavirus disease 2019; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Wuhan.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":4,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"71-80 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":true,"other_comorbid":"COPD, chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) for 5 years","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection,","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient had a medical history including chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) for five years, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.

Clinical presentations were similar with fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal complaints, and/or rash. One patient had altered mental status with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings consistent with aseptic meningitis. Laboratory values were remarkable for high levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimers, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin in all patients. All had low albumin levels. Evaluation for other infectious etiologies was negative. All of the patients were critically ill, requiring admission to the intensive care unit. All had circulatory shock and needed inotropes. Two patients had respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support and one had cardiac dysfunction. All patients received steroids, and two received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). One patient received tocilizumab. None of the children died.
