The unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the wellbeing of vulnerable patients, particularly the elderly and those with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases (2). Because no specific antiviral therapy is currently approved for COVID-19, treatment is supportive (at times intensive) and has severely stretched global hospital staffing and equipment capacity. Here, we report on outpatient management of a patient with concomitant idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) and COVID-19 using inhaled nitric oxide (iNO).","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory Tract Infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This entire treatment plan was designed remotely through TeleHealth visits","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[9342]}]
