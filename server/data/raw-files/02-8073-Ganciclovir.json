Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the susceptibility of COVID-19 in IgG4-RD patients in Hubei province, and to characterize the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in IgG4-RD patients.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              A follow-up system that includes over 200 IgG4-RD patients across the country during the past ten years. A total of ninety-one patients with IgG4-RD who live in Hubei, China were identified and responded to our survey. Medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, CT imaging, and treatment were obtained through a standardized data collection form, and then independently reviewed by two investigators.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              2 of 91 cases were infected with COVID-19. Both of them were classified as moderate type. The symptoms such as fever and cough and radiologic features were similar to other COVID-19 patients. Neither of them episode recurrent of IgG4-RD nor progressed to severe or critical condition of COVID-19 under the condition of continuous oral low-dose of glucocorticoids.
