The virus is highly infectious. Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3\r\n+\r\n T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients. And the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients is challenged by the immunosuppressive state of these patients under chemotherapy or surgery.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Cancer; Coronavirus disease 2019; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Wuhan.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":4,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"71-80 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":true,"other_comorbid":"COPD, chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) for 5 years","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection,","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient had a medical history including chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) for five years, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.

disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered to be spread primarily by people who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we discuss a patient with severe COVID-19 and a history of type 2 diabetes who had a recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) after recovering. The patient was initially discharged after two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and partially absorbed bilateral lesions on chest computed tomography (CT). However, at his first follow-up, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay with an oropharyngeal swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Despite this, he displayed no obvious clinical symptoms and improved chest CT. The patient was prescribed anti-viral medication. Eight consecutive RT-PCR assays on oropharyngeal swab specimens were conducted after he was re-admitted to our hospital. The results tested positive on the 12th, 14th, 19th, 23rd and 26th of March and negative on the 28th of March, and 6th and 12th of April. After his second discharge, he has tested negative for 5 weeks. This case highlights the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the follow-up period so that an infectivity assessment can be made.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronavirus disease 2019; Recurrence; SARS-CoV-2; Severe; Type 2 diabetes.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"5 weeks","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a history of diabetes.

We investigated changes in the fecal fungal microbiomes (mycobiome) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and on recovery.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 30 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through May 12, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronovirus; Intestine; Microbe; Yeast.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":30,"article_patient_number":"11","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Hong Kong","country_treated":"Hong Kong","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"hyperlipidemia, left subclavian artery occlusion","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, fever, cough, sputum, dyspnea","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and left subclavian artery occlusion.
