Thus far, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. The immune system and inflammation are proposed to play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. Intravenous infusion of MSCs has shown promising results in COVID-19 treatment. Here, we report a case of a severe COVID-19 patient treated with human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (hWJCs) from a healthy donor in Liaocheng People's Hospital, China, from February 24, 2020. The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment. After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition. This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"6 days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"According to the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 [14], the patient was treated with antiviral therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, IFN-α inhalation, and also intravenous injection of levofloxacin, tanreqing capsule, xuebijing, thymosin α1, methylprednisolone, and immunoglobulin. During this time, the patient received antipyretic therapy. More treatments were conducted consisting of electrocardiograph monitoring, potassium chloride sustained-release tablets (oral, 1 g per time, 2 times per day), plasma exchange and regulated intestinal microflora of patient, etc. Finally, the discomfort was released, and the oxygen saturation increased to 98%. On February 13 to 21, the patient’s vital physical signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers and shortness of breath.\r\nOn February 22, the patient took a turn for the worse. Considering the severe organ injury caused by an inflammatory response, hWJC adoptive transfer therapy was proposed under the advice and guidance of the specialist group. The family member and patient agreed to try hWJC adoptive transfer therapy. The therapeutic scheme was then discussed and approved by the ethics committee of the hospital, and consent forms were signed by the family member before the therapy. On February 24, the patient receives hWJC transfusion.\r\n\r\nOn March 1, the patient felt much better. The shortness of breath was significantly recovering. The CRP decreased to 27.2 g/L, the absolute lymphocyte count rose to 0.66 × 109/L, and the inflammatory factors reduced to normal levels, which indicated that the patient was recovering rapidly.
