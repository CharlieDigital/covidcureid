December 2019, in Wuhan, China. As of today, 3 April 2020, 972,640 people affected and 50,325 people died from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2. There is not any standard treatment for coronavirus infection 2019; however, there are promising data for hydroxychloroquine and some anti-retroviral drugs. Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) pathway is an important target for the cancer immunotherapy. However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections. Thus, blockade of this pathway may lead to an anti-viral effect and decrease viral load. Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma. In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding. We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab. It is impossible to say that blockade of PD-1/PDL-1pathway is a treatment option for COVID-19; however, we want to share our experience.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; SARS-CoV2; immunotherapy.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"71-80 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Turkey","country_treated":"Turkey","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"metastic malignant melanoma patient, atrial fibrillation","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"While waiting for the test result, oseltamivir 75 mg BID and clarithromycin 500 mg BID were started due to community-acquired pneumonia.

During hospitalization, another patient with no pulmonary shadows on admission developed pneumonia. In total, 11 (78.6%) of the 14 patients developed pneumonia, indicating its high prevalence in COVID-19. During hospitalization, the patients' symptoms spontaneously relapsed and resolved, and gastrointestinal symptoms were frequently found. C-reactive protein values showed correlation with the patients' clinical courses. Ritonavir/lopinavir were administered to 5 patients whose respiratory conditions worsened during admission, all of whom improved. However, the pneumonia in the 6 other patients improved without antivirals. None of the 14 patients died, whereas 5 other patients with cHCoV pneumonia were in respiratory failure on admission, and one patient (20%) died.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Both SARS-CoV-2 and cHCoV can cause severe pneumonia. Problems for future resolution include whether antiviral agents administered in cases of mild or moderate severity can reduce the number of severe cases, and whether antivirals administered in severe cases can reduce mortality.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; BVBs, bronchovascular bundles; COVID-19; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CRP, C-reactive protein; CT, computed tomography; GGOs, ground-glass opacities; HFNC, high-flow nasal cannula; Novel coronavirus 2019; Pneumonia; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2; Wuhan; cHCoV, conventional human coronavirus.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":11,"article_patient_number":"9","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"None","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"We started ceftriaxone plus clarithromycin, and his condition gradually improved.
