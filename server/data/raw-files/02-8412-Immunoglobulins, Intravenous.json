On January 17, 2020, the patient presented a feeling of general malaise and coldness. On January 19, she had fever with body temperature of 37.3 °C and experienced diarrhea and vomiting. She started to receive intravenous injection of cefotaxime in community clinic and took oral Jinyebaidu granules (another Chinese traditional patent medicine) and oseltamivir\r\n(75 mg, twice a day) for 4 days. She had persistent severe fever with body temperature from 37.6 °C to\r\n38.3 °C for four days. On January 23, her chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple patchy ground glass opacity and consolidation shadow in bilateral lung and sub-pleural regions.  She was highly suspected with COVID-19.  Oral moxifloxacin and arbidol were prescribed, and she continued to take Jinyebaidu granules and oseltamivir. On January 24, her body temperature reached 39.9 °C and experienced severe fatigue, diarrhea, and breathlessness despite continuous treatments of the above drugs. She felt better after intravenous injection of immunoglobin (IVIG, 5 g per day) and dexamethasone (5 mg, once to twice a day). However, the patient experienced recurrent fever (body temperature of 39 °C) and breathlessness, and her blood oxygen saturation fluctuated from 90% to 95% at the night of January 27. On January 28, the second chest CT scan indicated that her pneumonia aggravated for the past 5 days (Fig. 1B). A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was obtained and sent for detection of 2019-nCoV. Although the patient’s 2019-nCoV test was negative (Table 1), she was diagnosed of COVID-19 in accordance with her symptoms and chest CT display. On the same day, she was confined into an isolation ward and started to take oral SHL (twice a day, 20 mL once). On the next day, SHL administration increased to three times a day (20 mL once) without using any other drugs. From January 29 to 31, the patient’s symptoms resolved with body temperature decreasing from 37.3 °C to 36.5 °C and without vomiting and diarrhea. The patient gradually felt strong except for slight cough. After February 6, the patient’s symptoms disappeared, and her third chest CT scan (Fig. 1C) showed significant absorption of bilateral ground glass opacity compared with the previous ones.\r\n\r\nEver

Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the expression of 2019-nCoV proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. \r\nResults:\r\n Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous exudation and fibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils were also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type II alveolar epithelia and focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization of exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosiswere observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type II alveolar epithelia were observed under electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Decreased numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen. Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes of chronic diseases were observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection was observed in these organs. \r\nConclusion:\r\n s The lungs from novel coronavirus pneumonia patients manifest significant pathological lesions, including the alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation. While the 2019-nCoV is mainly distributed in lung, the infection also involves in the damages of heart, vessels, liver, kidney and other organs. Further studies are warranted to investigate the mechanism underlying pathological changes of this disease.","article_type":"","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":false,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"","country_treated":"","began_treatment_year":"","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"diabetes, double lung bronchiectasis","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"","clinical_syndrome":"Hypothermia, cough, running nose and fatigue","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"","additional_info":"Ever on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: NR\r\nAuthor defined severe?: NR\r\nJustification for author-indicated response: \"The total course of disease from onset to death is 17-19 days\"\r\nDay in disease course that symptoms were noted to begin improving: NR\r\nDay in disease course that full resolution of symptoms was noted: NR\r\nDay in disease course that patient was discharged if admitted: NR","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8412,11312,9077,11388,11327]},{"id":5424,"regimens":[{"id":10123,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":11312,"name":"Interferon Alfa-1B","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11312","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5782,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10123},{"id":5783,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10123}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.155389Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.576283Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424},{"id":10124,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":11388,"name":"Pinavir/ Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11388","rxNorm_id":23,"notes":""},"use_drug":[{"id":5784,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10124},{"id":5785,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10124}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.160786Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.618267Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424},{"id":10125,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":11327,"name":"Thymosin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11327","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5786,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10125},{"id":5787,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10125}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.166097Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.584487Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424},{"id":10126,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":9077,"name":"Methylprednisolone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9077","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5788,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10126},{"id":5789,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10126}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.171494Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.588084Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424},{"id":10127,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":8412,"name":"Immunoglobulins, Intravenous","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8412","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5790,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10127},{"id":5791,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10127}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.177494Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.592016Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":11788,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5424},{"id":11849,"answer":"Pathology","answer_other":"","report":5424}],"author_username":"CURE ID Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1892,"name":"Coronavirus -

Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the expression of 2019-nCoV proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. \r\nResults:\r\n Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous exudation and fibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils were also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type II alveolar epithelia and focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization of exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosiswere observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type II alveolar epithelia were observed under electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Decreased numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen. Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes of chronic diseases were observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection was observed in these organs. \r\nConclusion:\r\n s The lungs from novel coronavirus pneumonia patients manifest significant pathological lesions, including the alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation. While the 2019-nCoV is mainly distributed in lung, the infection also involves in the damages of heart, vessels, liver, kidney and other organs.

Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections that respiratory complications are the most obvious symptoms. In this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time. We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides. Further investigations should be conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Case report; Guillain Barre syndrome; Neuropathy; Novel coronavirus.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":false,"outcome":"Patient deteriorated","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory Tract Infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Development of GBS after COVID-19 diagnosis","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"2 weeks","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient treated for COVID19 and then developed neurological symptoms related to GBS two weeks later.

There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              When the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS-CoV-2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms that could be a manifestation of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions. Both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, and anorexia and associated with elevation of CRP and ferritin, but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              Our report suggests that XLA patients might present with high risk to develop pneumonia after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but can recover from infection, suggesting that B-cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease.

Repeat nasopharyngeal COVID-19 RT-PCR was positive. Multiplex PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirate detected Coronavirus OC43 and Human Rhino/Enterovirus. As he improved, he was gradually weaned off HFNC. Blood cultures showed no growth and antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. In light of the persistent high-grade fever and elevated CRP (121 mg/L), 72 hours after IVIG infusion, he was given tocilizumab (8 mg/kg IV over 2 hours).

Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the susceptibility of COVID-19 in IgG4-RD patients in Hubei province, and to characterize the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in IgG4-RD patients.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              A follow-up system that includes over 200 IgG4-RD patients across the country during the past ten years. A total of ninety-one patients with IgG4-RD who live in Hubei, China were identified and responded to our survey. Medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, CT imaging, and treatment were obtained through a standardized data collection form, and then independently reviewed by two investigators.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              2 of 91 cases were infected with COVID-19. Both of them were classified as moderate type. The symptoms such as fever and cough and radiologic features were similar to other COVID-19 patients. Neither of them episode recurrent of IgG4-RD nor progressed to severe or critical condition of COVID-19 under the condition of continuous oral low-dose of glucocorticoids.

Thus far, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. The immune system and inflammation are proposed to play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. Intravenous infusion of MSCs has shown promising results in COVID-19 treatment. Here, we report a case of a severe COVID-19 patient treated with human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (hWJCs) from a healthy donor in Liaocheng People's Hospital, China, from February 24, 2020. The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment. After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition. This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"6 days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"According to the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 [14], the patient was treated with antiviral therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, IFN-α inhalation, and also intravenous injection of levofloxacin, tanreqing capsule, xuebijing, thymosin α1, methylprednisolone, and immunoglobulin.

On 08 March 2020 the clinical condition of the patient deteriorated, and he exhibited dyspnea with an oxygen saturation of 85%. Fever and cough were persistent, and new chest X-ray imaging revealed progression of bilateral infiltration in the lower and upper lobes. It was decided to initiate ribavirin 1,200 mg p.o. b.i.d. and immunoglobulin 20 mg i.v. daily. Meropenem and teicoplanin were also started to cover any probable bacterial sources. After 2 days, on 10 March 2020, his clinical condition worsened. Dyspnea continued with greater severity and he had an oxygen saturation of 83%.the patient was a candidate for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, this did not happen. Tocilizumab was considered as a last-chance therapy.Hence, tocilizumab (Actemra Hoffmann-La Roche Limited) at a single dose of 400 mg was infused over 2 hours. After 2 days, the patient's dyspnea had gradually improved and his oxygen saturation increased to 90%.Recovery was observed over the next few days, and dyspnea and oxygen saturation significantly improved.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342,8412,8466,8783,9463,10130,10776]},{"id":6167,"regimens":[{"id":11746,"duration":{"id":5747,"approximate_duration":"2 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8412,"name":"Immunoglobulins, Intravenous","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8412","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8726,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11746},{"id":8727,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11746}],"created":"2020-10-01T13:38:51.269592Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:35:57.555798Z","dose":"2 g/kg","frequency":"QD","route":"IV","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6167},{"id":11747,"duration":{"id":5748,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":11165,"name":"Favipiravir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11165","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8728,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11747},{"id":8729,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11747}],"created":"2020-10-01T13:38:51.278218Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:35:57.562289Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6167}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13778,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6167},{"id":13779,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6167}],"author_username":"Holly Graber","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Pharmacist","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4174,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6167},{"id":4175,"answer":"Patient failed previous therapy","answer_other":"","report":6167}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-10-01T13:37:44.410569Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:35:57.547946Z","title":"COVID-19 presenting with immune thrombocytopenia: A case report and review of the literature.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32497344,"doi":"10.1002/jmv.26138","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32497344/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Murt A\r\nEskazan AE\r\nYılmaz U\r\nOzkan T\r\nAr MC","article_author_email":"emreeskazan@hotmail.com;  emre.eskazan@istanbul.edu.tr","journal":"Journal of medical virology","abstract":"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) may be associated with thrombocytopenia which might have different mechanisms in different patients and in different phases of the disease.

It is largely unknown whether the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic immune diseases has some specific manifestations, or makes them more prone to rapidly progress into severe COVID-19. In this case report, we describe the clinical features of 5 rheumatic immune disease patients with the concomitant presence of COVID-19. Amongst these patients, 4 had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 1 had systemic sclerosis (SSc). Two patients had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient. The age of the patients ranged between 51 and 79 years. Fever (80%), cough (80%), dyspnea (40%), and fatigue (20%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Laboratory investigations revealed leukopenia and lymphopenia in 2 patients. In all the patients, chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed patchy ground glass opacities in the lungs. During the hospital stay, the condition of two patients remained the same (i.e., mild COVID-19), two patients progressed to the severe COVID-19, and one patient worsened to the critically ill COVID-19. These patients were treated with antiviral agents for COVID-19, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, and immunomodulatory agents for rheumatic immune diseases. All the patients responded well, were cured of COVID-19, and subsequently discharged.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Coronavirus; Rheumatic immune disease;

Despite immunoglobulin infusions and intensive supportive care, her clinical picture worsened simultaneously both from the respiratory and neurological point of view, as if reflecting different aspects of the same systemic inflammatory response.

populations emphasized a mild course of disease with severe cases disproportionately affecting infant and comorbid pediatric patients. After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by a SARS-CoV-2-positive female child who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal

pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus have been discovered in Wuhan, China, and such cases have spread nationwide quickly. At present, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic. What are the clinical features of this disease? What is the clinical diagnosis and how should such patients be treated? As a clinician, mastery of the clinical characteristics, basic diagnosis, and treatment methods of COVID-19 are required to provide help to patients.          \r\n        Case summary:      \r\n              A 40-some-old patient with a cough lasting 6 d without obvious cause, as well as fever and fatigue for 1 d, was admitted to Hankou Hospital on January 22, 2020 and transferred to Huoshenshan Hospital on February 4. The main clinical symptoms were dry cough, fatigue, and fever. He was diagnosed with COVID-19. From the 4\r\nth\r\n d of admission, the patient's condition gradually worsened, with increased respiratory rate and body temperature. Peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased progressively. On the 8\r\nth\r\n d of admission, the patient's highest temperature was 40.7 °C, and oxygen saturation was 83% despite high-flow oxygen inhalation. Chest computed tomography results showed that the virus progressed rapidly. The number of lesions significantly increased with expanded scope and increased density. The distribution of lesions advanced from peripheral to central. In addition to nasal catheter oxygen inhalation and symptomatic support, antiviral drugs were used throughout the treatment. On January 22, oseltamivir phosphate capsules were given orally (75 mg, twice daily) for 6 d. On January 24, three tablets of lopinavir and ritonavir were added orally (twice daily). After 6 d, this was changed to 0.2 g (two tablets) arbidol, taken orally (three times daily) for 5 d. During the severe stage, methylprednisolone was given (40 mg) once every 12 h, immunoglobulin (20 g) was administered by intravenous drip infusion once daily, and thymosin (1.6 mg) was injected subcutaneously once daily combined with immunotherapy. On February 2, symptoms decreased, various indicators improved, and pulmonary inflammation was obviously reduced. Throat swabs on February 4 and 9 were negative for novel coronavirus nucleic acid. After 19 d in the hospital, the patient was successfully treated and discharged.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              COVID-19 in young adults can be successfully treated with active treatment. We report a typical case of COVID-19, analyze its clinical characteristics, summarize its clinical diagnosis and treatment experience, and provide a reference for clinical colleagues.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Case report; Clinical characteristics; Diagnosis and treatment; SARS-CoV-2; Young adults.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection, pulmonary lesions, fatigue, fever","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8412,8783,9077,9463,11327,10942]},{"id":6469,"regimens":[{"id":12635,"duration":{"id":6627,"approximate_duration":"2 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8412,"name":"Immunoglobulins, Intravenous","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8412","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10611,"answer":"Other","answer_other":"Given fro ITP","regimen":12635}],"created":"2020-11-16T15:54:05.320872Z","updated":"2020-11-17T17:57:15.838846Z","dose":"1 g/kg","frequency":"","route":"IV","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6469},{"id":12636,"duration":{"id":6628,"approximate_duration":"2 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":9905,"name":"Prednisolone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9905","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10612,"answer":"Other","answer_other":"Given for ITP","regimen":12636}],"created":"2020-11-16T15:54:05.329173Z","updated":"2020-11-17T17:57:15.839755Z","dose":"1 mg/kg","frequency":"","route":"PO","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6469}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8504,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6469},{"id":8505,"answer":"Serology","answer_other":"","report":6469}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14538,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6469},{"id":14539,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6469}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4607,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6469}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-11-16T15:53:22.330751Z","updated":"2020-11-17T17:57:15.793869Z","title":"Immune thrombocytopenia flare with mild COVID-19 infection in pregnancy: A case report.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32516503,"doi":"10.1111/bjh.16928","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32516503/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Nesr G\r\nGarnett C\r\nBailey C\r\nKoshy R\r\nArami S","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"British journal of haematology","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is the third zoonotic coronavirus to be identified in humans during the twenty‐first century, after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV)(Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy,of Viruses, 2020).

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned. Nineteen patients had an uneventful recovery (65.5%). In group 1, 3 of 6 patients died (50%) and 1 of 6 required invasive mechanical ventilation (16.7%). In group 2, 3 of 23 patients died (12.5%).

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned.

disease with many undescribed clinical manifestations. We report herein a case of severe immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in a critical COVID-19 patient. A patient presented a severe episode of immune thrombocytopenia (< 10 × 109/L) 20 days after admission for a critical COVID-19. This thrombocytopenia was associated with a life-threatening bleeding. Response to first-line therapies was delayed as it took up to 13 days after initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose dexamethasone to observe an increase in platelet count. COVID-19 may be associated with late presenting severe ITP. Such ITP may also be relatively resistant to first-line agents. Hematological manifestations of COVID-19, such as the ones associated with life-threatening bleeding, must be recognized.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Bleeding; COVID-19; Corticosteroids; Immunoglobulin; Thrombocytopenia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient deteriorated","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Canada","country_treated":"Canada","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Dyslipidemia","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including hyper tension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes.

This treatment regimen was associated with a prompt resolution of respiratory failure, elimination of clinical manifestations of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and reversal of pulmonary CT changes. The treatment was generally safe and well-tolerated. There was no evidence of protracted persistence of the virus in the patients.

It is not known whether the disease is associated with a higher risk of infection in pregnant women or whether intrauterine vertical transmission can occur. We report 2 cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.          \r\n        Patient concerns:      \r\n              In all of Yichang city from January 20, 2020, to April 9, 2020, only 2 pregnant women, who were in the late stage of pregnancy, were diagnosed with COVID-19; one patient was admitted for fever with limb asthenia, and the other patient was admitted for abnormal chest computed tomography results.          \r\n        Diagnoses:      \r\n              Both pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19.          \r\n        Interventions:      \r\n              After the medical staff prepared for isolation and protection, the 2 pregnant women quickly underwent cesarean sections. A series of tests, such as laboratory, imaging, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid examinations, were performed on the 2 women with COVID-19 and their newborns.          \r\n        Outcomes:      \r\n              One of the 2 infected pregnant women had severe COVID-19, and the other had mild disease. Both babies were delivered by cesarean section. Both of the women with COVID-19 worsened 3 to 6 days after delivery. Chest computed tomography suggested that the lesions due to SARS-CoV-2 infection increased. These women began to exhibit fever or reduced blood oxygen saturation again. One of the 2 newborns was born prematurely, and the other was born at full term. Neither infant was infected with COVID-19, but both had increased prothrombin time and fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphocreatine kinase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme contents.          \r\n        Lessons:      \r\n              SARS-CoV-2 infection was not found in the newborns born to the 2 pregnant women with COVID-19, but transient coagulation dysfunction and myocardial damage occurred in the 2 newborns. Effective management strategies for pregnant women with COVID-19 will help to control the outbreak of COVID-19 among pregnant women.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":true,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, bilateral lung infection, limb asthenia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Patient was 36 weeks pregnant when admitted for COVID-19 infection","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"A cesarean section was performed 3 hours after admission on the same day because of fetal distress observed from the baseline fetal heart rate monitoring.\r\n\r\nThe neonate’s throat swab, anal swab, urine, and blood were negative for SARS-CoV-2.\r\n\r\nPatient was additionally treated with unidentified glucocorticoids (1-2mg/kg/day).","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6772,8412,8459,10942]},{"id":6698,"regimens":[{"id":13420,"duration":{"id":7309,"approximate_duration":"5 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8412,"name":"Immunoglobulins, Intravenous","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8412","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11995,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13420}],"created":"2020-12-08T20:42:18.564687Z","updated":"2020-12-08T20:49:06.685914Z","dose":"0.4 grams/kg","frequency":"QD","route":"IV","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"Patient was monitored in ICU due to increasing weakness and swallowing difficulties; patient did not need to be intubated","comments":null,"report":6698}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8791,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6698}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":15109,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6698},{"id":15110,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6698},{"id":15111,"answer":"Serology","answer_other":"","report":6698}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4890,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6698},{"id":4891,"answer":"Unusual disease presentation","answer_other":"","report":6698}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[],"races":[{"id":538,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-12-08T20:41:13.507141Z","updated":"2020-12-08T20:49:06.678240Z","title":"Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection: a case from the UK.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32641309,"doi":"10.1136/bcr-2020-236536","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32641309/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Tiet MY\r\nAlShaikh N","article_author_email":"m.tiet@doctors.org.uk","journal":"BMJ case reports","abstract":"Originating from Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide.

However, as 50% of the patients remained hospitalised at the time of publication, the authors cannot comment on the duration and eventual outcome of COVID-19 in all of their patients. Furthermore, it is emerging that hydroxychloroquine does not alter COVID-19. As such, we actually believe that other immunosuppressive, antirheumatic medications require more attention. Mathian et al rightfully pointed out that besides long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment, steroids and other baseline immunosuppressant drugs are often present in patients with rheumatic diseases.

been found to be associated with a higher risk of hospitalization with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used controller medications in patients with asthma. It is unclear whether ICS use increases the risk for severe COVID-19 infection. At the current time, asthma organizations are still recommending the continued use of ICS and other asthma medications to minimize the risk of uncontrolled asthma. However, for patients with asthma and who have recovered from COVID-19 infection, the timing of resumption of asthma therapy is equally uncertain. Pulmonary function testing and exhaled oral nitric oxide testing are aerosol-generating procedures and are currently being severely restricted at most health-care facilities. We presented a case of a patient with cough-variant asthma who developed severe COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome with the need for intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation. We highlighted the potential utility of using COVID-19 RNA detection as well as immunoglobulin G antibody testing to help guide the timing of resumption of asthma therapy.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":true,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"The patient traveled to Madrid, Spain, and 5 days later on return, he developed fever, myalgia, and cough.

Although monocytes and protein levels in CSF were only marginally increased, and our patient never experienced a hyperinflammatory state, her neurologic function deteriorated into coma. MRI of the brain showed pathologic signal symmetrically in central thalami, subinsular regions, medial temporal lobes, and brain stem. Extremely high concentrations of the neuronal injury markers neurofilament light and tau, as well as an astrocytic activation marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, were measured in CSF. Neuronal rescue proteins and other pathways were elevated in the in-depth proteomics analysis. The patient received IV immunoglobulins and plasma exchange. Her neurologic status improved, and she was extubated 4 weeks after symptom onset.

On day 9, after admission, the chest computed tomography scan showed diffuse ground-glass shadows in the patient's bilateral lungs. On day 11, his respiratory symptoms worsened. Subsequently, type I respiratory failure was diagnosed, coinciding with kidney injury, and subsequently, type II respiratory failure occurred, coupled with multiorgan failure including the heart and liver. However, the patient's constitution worsened although SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative since day 13. He died on day 21. Lung biopsy showed areas of diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by extensive acute alveolitis with numerous intra-alveolar neutrophil, lymphocyte, and macrophage infiltrations. Microthrombi were seen in the dilated pulmonary capillaries. Immunohistochemistry staining for SARS-CoV-2 N protein was negative. Taken together, the patient died of multiorgan failure although the SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared already, implicating that for disease worsening, no active SARS-CoV-2 infection is required.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Clinical manifestation and lung histological alteration showed that this patient suffered from SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia.
