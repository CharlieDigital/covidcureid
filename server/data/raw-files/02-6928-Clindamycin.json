Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given (2 g/kg) with aspirin (75 mg once-a-day). Echocardiogram did not show any abnormalities and repeat chest Xray showed increased right-sided infiltrates. Repeat nasopharyngeal COVID-19 RT-PCR was positive. Multiplex PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirate detected Coronavirus OC43 and Human Rhino/Enterovirus. As he improved, he was gradually weaned off HFNC. Blood cultures showed no growth and antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. In light of the persistent high-grade fever and elevated CRP (121 mg/L), 72 hours after IVIG infusion, he was given tocilizumab (8 mg/kg IV over 2 hours). Twelve hours later, his fever spikes settled, and inflammatory parameters rapidly decreased to baseline.

populations emphasized a mild course of disease with severe cases disproportionately affecting infant and comorbid pediatric patients. After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by a SARS-CoV-2-positive female child who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal dysfunction and fluid-refractory hypotension requiring vasopressors and PICU admission.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Child; Coronavirus; Enoxaparin; Pediatric;

An emerging disease entity coined as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) has been reported recently, but is very rare and only affects a very small minority of children. Here we describe the clinical presentations and outcomes of three teenagers with serologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit for PIMS-TS. Although their initial presentations were very similar, their COVID-19-related disease varied in severity.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Series","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"16-20 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"United Kingdom","country_treated":"United Kingdom","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, fever","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"clinical presentations and outcomes of three teenagers with serologically‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit for PIMS‐TS.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6038,6675,6928,8412]}]
