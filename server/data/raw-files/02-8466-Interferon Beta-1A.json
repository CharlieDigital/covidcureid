The patient was a physician with a history of close contact with COVID-19 cases. The following were commenced: hydroxychloroquine 200 mg p.o. twice a day, oseltamivir 75 mg p.o. twice a day, lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50 mg p.o. in two tablets twice a day, and interferon Î²-1a 12 million units s.c. every other day. On 08 March 2020 the clinical condition of the patient deteriorated, and he exhibited dyspnea with an oxygen saturation of 85%. Fever and cough were persistent, and new chest X-ray imaging revealed progression of bilateral infiltration in the lower and upper lobes. It was decided to initiate ribavirin 1,200 mg p.o. b.i.d. and immunoglobulin 20 mg i.v. daily. Meropenem and teicoplanin were also started to cover any probable bacterial sources. After 2 days, on 10 March 2020, his clinical condition worsened. Dyspnea continued with greater severity and he had an oxygen saturation of 83%.the patient was a candidate for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, this did not happen. Tocilizumab was considered as a last-chance therapy.Hence, tocilizumab (Actemra Hoffmann-La Roche Limited) at a single dose of 400 mg was infused over 2 hours. After 2 days, the patient's dyspnea had gradually improved and his oxygen saturation increased to 90%.Recovery was observed over the next few days, and dyspnea and oxygen saturation significantly improved.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342,8412,8466,8783,9463,10130,10776]}]
