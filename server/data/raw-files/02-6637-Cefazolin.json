disease with many undescribed clinical manifestations. We report herein a case of severe immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in a critical COVID-19 patient. A patient presented a severe episode of immune thrombocytopenia (< 10 × 109/L) 20 days after admission for a critical COVID-19. This thrombocytopenia was associated with a life-threatening bleeding. Response to first-line therapies was delayed as it took up to 13 days after initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose dexamethasone to observe an increase in platelet count. COVID-19 may be associated with late presenting severe ITP. Such ITP may also be relatively resistant to first-line agents. Hematological manifestations of COVID-19, such as the ones associated with life-threatening bleeding, must be recognized.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Bleeding; COVID-19; Corticosteroids; Immunoglobulin; Thrombocytopenia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient deteriorated","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Canada","country_treated":"Canada","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Dyslipidemia","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including hyper tension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes.

They were also administered propofol, fentanyl, and cisatracurium infusion and thromboprophylaxis (unfractionated heparin). They experienced acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy, a methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureoles ventilator-associated pneumonia treated with a two day course of empirical piperacillin-tazobactam and six days of cefazolin, ICU-acquired neuropathy, and a tracheotomy. A CT scan revealed a small spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage.
