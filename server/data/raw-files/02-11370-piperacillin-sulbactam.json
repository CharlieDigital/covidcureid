Despite oxygen supplementation and cPAP, however, due to rapid respiratory deterioration in the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the patient was eventually admitted to the ICU and required intubation on February 28. During his stay in the ICU, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and anakinra was maintained, while piperacillin-tazobactam and linezolid were started in place of levofloxacin. In addition, he required vasopressor support with noradrenaline. His clinical conditions progressively improved and, after discontinuing antibiotics on March 3 and invasive mechanical ventilation on March 4, the patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit on March 5.\r\n\r\nOn March 8, after 2 days of diarrhea, the patient complained of abdominal pain and marked distension; at clinical examination, signs of peritoneal irritation were detected. A plain X-ray film and a CT scan showed massive free air in the abdominal cavity, distension of the large bowel, and perforation of the ascending colon. In addition, pulmonary embolism was detected. The patient underwent emergent laparotomy: intraoperative findings included profuse amount of free air, distension of the entire abdominal colon, and a minimal perforation on the anterolateral aspect of the distended cecum. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular weight heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and fluconazole were started immediately after surgery.  chest X-ray showed resolution of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Lopinavir/ritonavir was discontinued on March 11, while hydroxychloroquine and anakinra were maintained until March 18.\r\n\r\nThe patient was discharged on postoperative day 18 (March 26). The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal on March 23 tested positive, and the patient was encouraged to maintain home quarantine for at least 14 days.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5926,8342,8711,8745,8782,11370]}]
