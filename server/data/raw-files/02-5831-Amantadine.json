Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nTo describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\r\nStudy Design\r\n\r\nWe describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nAmong 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"30 3/7 weeks’ gestation","pregnant":true,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"A 25- to 29-year-old previously healthy gravida at 30 3/7 weeks’ gestation was seen in the outpatient antenatal clinic the day before admission with a complaint of sore throat and rhinorrhea with dry cough, but she was afebrile and did not have dyspnea. She was admitted the next day after becoming febrile (39°C) and experiencing shortness of breath and was normotensive (125/80 mm Hg). On the day of admission, chest CT had features of viral pneumonia, laboratory values were significant for lymphopenia and pancytopenia, and antepartum testing for fetal well-being was reassuring. The SARS-CoV-2 testing was done, but her test results were not positive until the day of death. Nonetheless, she was initiated on oseltamivir, azithromycin, and ceftazidime at the time of admission. She experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 24 hours later and was transferred to the ICU and intubated; linezolid and amantadine were added. Later that evening, onset of spontaneous labor accompanied persistent oxygen desaturations (SaO2 88% on ventilator support), with spontaneous vaginal delivery of an intrauterine fetal death (IUFD, stillbirth) the following morning. With persistent postpartum ARDS (SaO2 85%–90% on maximal ventilator support), meropenem, vancomycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir were added. She experienced acute hypotension and bradycardia 8 hours later and died despite cardiopulmonary resuscitative efforts. There are 3 other household members in her familial cohort: her son was diagnosed as having mild COVID-19 by clinical symptoms, and her father and husband had prolonged exposure. He recovered, and all are alive and well.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5831,6122,6667,8745,8783,9463]},{"id":6193,"regimens":[{"id":11824,"duration":{"id":5822,"approximate_duration":"14 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":5831,"name":"Amantadine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/5831","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8886,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11824},{"id":8887,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11824}],"created":"2020-10-05T23:51:44.063238Z","updated":"2020-10-08T20:14:44.745583Z","dose":"100 mg","frequency":"BID","route":"Po","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6193},{"id":11825,"duration":{"id":5823,"approximate_duration":"5 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":6038,"name":"Aspirin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6038","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8888,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11825},{"id":8889,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11825}],"created":"2020-10-05T23:51:44.070760Z","updated":"2020-10-08T20:14:44.752275Z","dose":"500 mg","frequency":"QD","route":"PO","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6193}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8126,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6193}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13833,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6193},{"id":13834,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6193}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin"}],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4217,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6193}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-10-05T23:50:41.311514Z","updated":"2020-10-08T20:14:44.737945Z","title":"Use of amantadine in a patient with SARS-CoV-2.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32542661,"doi":"10.1002/jmv.26179","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32542661/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Aranda-Abreu GE\r\nAranda-Martínez JD\r\nAraújo R","article_author_email":"garanda@uv.mx","journal":"Journal of medical virology","abstract":"No abstract available","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Mexico","country_treated":"Mexico","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory Tract Infection","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"His oxygen saturation was 84%, and he was given oxygen through a face mask.
