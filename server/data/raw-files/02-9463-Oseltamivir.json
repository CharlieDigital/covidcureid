Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nTo describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\r\nStudy Design\r\n\r\nWe describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nAmong 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"30 3/7 weeks’ gestation","pregnant":true,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"A 25- to 29-year-old previously healthy gravida at 30 3/7 weeks’ gestation was seen in the outpatient antenatal clinic the day before admission with a complaint of sore throat and rhinorrhea with dry cough, but she was afebrile and did not have dyspnea.

She experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 24 hours later and was transferred to the ICU and intubated; linezolid and amantadine were added. Later that evening, onset of spontaneous labor accompanied persistent oxygen desaturations (SaO2 88% on ventilator support), with spontaneous vaginal delivery of an intrauterine fetal death (IUFD, stillbirth) the following morning. With persistent postpartum ARDS (SaO2 85%–90% on maximal ventilator support), meropenem, vancomycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir were added.

Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\r\n\r\nObjective: To describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\r\n\r\nStudy design: We describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\r\n\r\nResults: Among 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).\r\n\r\nConclusion: We report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"5","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"A 30- to 34-year-old previously healthy gravida at 36 0/7 weeks’ gestation was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and gestational diabetes.","pregnant":true,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"A 30- to 34-year-old previously healthy gravida at 36 0/7 weeks’ gestation was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and initiated on ceftriaxone, oseltamivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir. She had experienced mild cold symptoms for 2 weeks before admission and reported being febrile with new onset dyspnea and dry cough on the day before admission. Her medical history was significant for type A2 gestational diabetes and managed on low-dose metformin (500 mg, twice daily). With concern for impending cardiopulmonary collapse, she underwent cesarean delivery of a viable neonate. With persistent hypoxia (SaO2 70%), tachypnea, and impending respiratory collapse, she was intubated 24 hours later, and her antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Over the next 5 days, her cardiopulmonary status worsened despite placement of chest tube, and despite maximal ventilator support, she died 1 day later and 3 hours after an initially successful resuscitation.

disease 2019 (COVID-19) hit major cities of China, Wuhan, late December 2019 and subsequently spread to other areas of China and countries (1). As of February 16, 2020, there were 68594 confirmed cases in mainland China. Among the confirmed cases, approximately 14.0% were severe (2). The mortality rate of severe patients was 6% (3). Herein, we described the clinical characteristics and chest CT follow-up of a severe COVID-19 patient, whose CT appearance was only moderate, and thus represents a case of mismatch between clinical severity and chest imaging severity.\r\n\r\nA 39-year-old man presented to the hospital on Jan 24, 2020 with a week of fever, nonproductive cough and fatigue. He lived in Wuhan before onset, with no underlying diseases. On admission, his body temperature elevated to 38.6 °C (101 °F) with rough breathing sounds. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the patient’ throat swab was positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Laboratory findings indicated elevated C-reactive protein of 24.86 mg/L (normal rage, 0–6 mg/L), lactic dehydrogenase of 339 U/L (normal range, 120–250 U/L), and urine protein of 1+ g/L. White blood cell count (3.66×109/L; normal range, 4.0–10.0×109/L) and lymphocyte count (1.31×109/L; normal range, 1.1–3.2×109/L) were normal. Liver function, myocardial enzymes and coagulation function were normal.

The patient was treated with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir and arbidol), anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., moxifloxacin) and mask oxygen inhalation (flow rate, 2–4 L/min). Follow-up chest CT of Jan 28, 2020 showed GGO with consolidation and air bronchogram (progressive stage). Follow-up chest CT of Jan 30, 2020 showed reduced GGO with pulmonary fibrosis (absorption stage). The patient was then at clinically severe stage for the partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and oxygen saturation (SO2) was 65 mmHg, 92%, respectively. On Feb 01, the patient’s PaO2 and SO2 further decreased to 51 mmHg and 86%. The patient had no fever and cough. The repeat RT-PCR of Feb 18 was negative. The chest CT of Feb 19, 2020 showed obvious absorption of lesions. The RT-PCR tests were repeated on Feb 24 and 25 and both were negative. On Feb 22, the patient’s SO2 elevated to a normal value of 98%. All laboratory findings were normal.

Currently, many strict control measures are applied in health care settings, including endoscopy units, in order to limit virus spread. Several recommendations called to limit endoscopic procedures to emergent endoscopies; however, several uncertainties still existing concerning patient safety, protective measures, and infection control methods in emergency endoscopic settings. In this case report, we present a case of successful endoscopic band ligation for bleeding esophageal varices in man with COVID‐19 disease who presented with an acute attack of hematemesis while on mechanical ventilation (MV). Esophago‐ gastroduodenoscopy was performed in the ICU room after preparing the setting, and revealed large, risky esophageal varices. Endoscopic band ligation was done with successful control of bleeding. Third‐level measures of medical protection were applied for the participating medical personnel, and patient monitoring was kept all through the procedure. After the procedure, the bleeding stopped, and the patient was vitally stable and conscious. We conclude that emergency endoscopic interventions could be performed safely with appropriate arrangements in patients with confirmed COVID‐19 on mechanical ventilation.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Yes","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Egypt","country_treated":"Egypt","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":true,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Hepatitis C","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Bilateral patchy lung consolidations and ground-glass opacities","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8711,8971,9463]},{"id":5845,"regimens":[{"id":10903,"duration":{"id":4961,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9463,"name":"Oseltamivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9463","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7140,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10903},{"id":7141,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10903}],"created":"2020-09-09T19:24:49.342131Z","updated":"2020-09-09T19:31:45.454604Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"PO","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5845},{"id":10904,"duration":{"id":4962,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7142,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10904},{"id":7143,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10904}],"created":"2020-09-09T19:24:49.350241Z","updated":"2020-09-09T19:31:45.461879Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"PO","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5845}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7624,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5845},{"id":7625,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5845},{"id":7626,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5845}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":12978,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5845},{"id":12979,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5845},{"id":12980,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5845}],"author_username":"Reema Charles","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3770,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5845}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":158,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-09T19:23:41.506704Z","updated":"2020-09-09T19:31:45.445837Z","title":"Clinical features of pediatric patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila.          \r\nCase presentation:      \r\n              Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. \r\nInfluenza B\r\n, human coronavirus 229E, \r\nStaphylococcus aureus\r\n and \r\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\r\n were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. \r\nInfluenza B\r\n and \r\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\r\n were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient's condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China.       \r\nConclusions:      \r\n              This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Case report; Coronavirus; Manila; Philippines;

In Bhutan, the index case was a 76-year-old immunocompromised man who had traveled\r\nfrom the United States and entered Bhutan as a tourist. He presented initially with vague gastrointerestinal symptoms and\r\nlater a cough. His atypical presentation led to a delay in diagnosis, but ultimately he was isolated and tested. On confirming\r\nthe diagnosis of COVID-19, the patient was isolated in a separate hospital with a dedicated medical care team. All\r\ncontacts were traced and quarantined. The patient’s respiratory status deteriorated despite broad-spectrum antivirals,\r\nantibiotics, and intensive supportive care. He required intubation and was given a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin to\r\nmodulate his likely aberrant immune response. Subsequently, the patient’s clinical status improved, and after 8 days of\r\nhospitalization, he was transferred out of the country, where he recovered. This was a learning experience for the treating\r\nmedical staff, the government, and the people of Bhutan.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

We present a 2019-nCoV patient with the onset of simple dizziness, accompanied by dry throat, no fever, no cough, no headache, no mental abnormality, and no obvious abnormality in the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. Meanwhile, chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple small spot shadows and interstitial changes in the early stage, especially in the extrapulmonary zone. There was a development of multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with mild pleural effusion. The nucleic acid gene detection was positive, and thus the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV was confirmed. At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment. After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered.

However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11%-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients were new-onset, moderate-severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6%-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV-2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; coronavirus disease 2019; headache pathophysiology; headache symptoms; inflammatory mediators; vasculopathy.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Turkey","country_treated":"Turkey","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"","clinical_syndrome":"Headache","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"He  did  not  have  any  fever  or  other  respiratory  tract  symptoms  at  admission,  but  lung  CT  ordered  due  to  close  contact  history  with  family  members  with  COVID-19  showed  mild  but  otherwise  typical  ground-glass  involvement  pattern.  \r\n\r\next  day,  his  fever  increased to 37.8°C, but his main complaint was still a severe headache, which he experienced for the first time in  his  life.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342,9463]},{"id":6055,"regimens":[{"id":11394,"duration":{"id":5449,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9463,"name":"Oseltamivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9463","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7914,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11394},{"id":7915,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11394}],"created":"2020-09-23T01:40:53.849342Z","updated":"2020-09-23T01:51:27.325014Z","dose":"75 mg","frequency":"BD","route":"Oral","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6055},{"id":11395,"duration":{"id":5450,"approximate_duration":"10 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8412,"name":"Immunoglobulins, Intravenous","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8412","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7916,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11395},{"id":7917,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11395}],"created":"2020-09-23T01:40:53.857204Z","updated":"2020-09-23T01:51:27.331685Z","dose":"10g/d","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6055}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7937,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6055},{"id":7938,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6055},{"id":7939,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6055}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13526,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6055},{"id":13527,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6055},{"id":13528,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6055}],"author_username":"Reema Charles","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4031,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6055}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":311,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-23T01:39:22.623472Z","updated":"2020-09-23T01:51:27.316803Z","title":"Clinical characteristics of IgG4-RD patients infected with COVID-19 in Hubei, China.

As of today, 3 April 2020, 972,640 people affected and 50,325 people died from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2. There is not any standard treatment for coronavirus infection 2019; however, there are promising data for hydroxychloroquine and some anti-retroviral drugs. Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) pathway is an important target for the cancer immunotherapy. However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections. Thus, blockade of this pathway may lead to an anti-viral effect and decrease viral load. Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma. In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding. We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.

A 59-year-old woman was admitted to the isolated ward for severe type of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. At the time of admission, her platelet count was in a normal range. Two days later, her platelet count decreased gradually without any signs or symptoms of bleeding. Since the peripheral blood smear showed a platelet aggregation, a blood sample anticoagulanted with citrate was tested and the number of platelet was normal.

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

coranovirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become an important health-care issue worldwide. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also raised concerns among patients with inflammatory rheumatic conditions and their treating physicians. There are emerging data regarding the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 for this particular patient group. However, less is known with regard to the course of COVID-19 among patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors. The aim of the current article is to review the growing body of knowledge on the course/management of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases by presenting a SARS-CoV-2 infected case with ankylosing spondylitis under secukinumab therapy. A 61-year old patient with ankylosing spondylitis who was on secukinumab therapy for 5 months admitted with newly onset fever and gastrointestinal complaints. After being hospitalized, she developed respiratory manifestations with focal pulmonary ground-glass opacities and multiple nodular densities in both lungs. The patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Substantial clinical improvement was obtained following a management plan, which included tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone and enoxaparin sodium. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched by using relevant keywords and their combinations. The literature search revealed four articles reporting the clinical course of COVID-19 in seven rheumatic patients on secukinumab. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mild in most of these patients, while one of them experienced severe COVID-19. Interleukin-17 has been related to the hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19 and IL-17 inhibitors were presented as promising targets for the prevention of aberrant inflammation and acute respiratory distress in COVID-19. However, this hypothesis still remains to be proved. Further studies are warranted in order to test the benefits and risks of IL-inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Ankylosing spondylitis; Biological drugs; COVID-19; Interleukin-17; Rheumatic diseases; Secukinumab; Spondyloarthritis.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Turkey","country_treated":"Turkey","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Ankylosing spondylitis on secukinumab","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"She had a history of ankylosing spondylitis dated back 11 years and over the past 5 months, she had been treated with secukinumab with a good clinical response.

The patient transported to the intensive care unit and was received supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula. On day 5, amylase increased to 285 U/L and lipase to 294 U/L. Chest computed tomography progressed to mild right pleural effusion, mild pericardial effusion, ground glass opacities, and diffused patchy consolidation. Abdominal computed tomography was reported to be normal.

We describe a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia, the only complaint of which is myalgia, and the first diagnosis is mild rhabdomyolysis. The patient had no evidence or history other than viral infection that could explain muscle pain and also increased level of muscle enzymes. When mild rhabdomyolysis lack of myoglobinuria and complications was diagnosed, treatment-related rhabdomyolysis was also avoided as no treatment related to COVID-19 was initiated yet. Apart from the typical symptoms leading to the typical diagnosis of COVID-19 at the first admission, SARS-CoV-2 related with rhabdomyolysis should also be kept in mind.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Turkey","country_treated":"Turkey","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, Skeletal Muscles","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, myalgia, fatigue, Rhabdomyolysis","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Unusual disease manifestation-patient first presented with Rhabdomyolysis and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Routine blood test results were as follows: white blood cells, 2.91 × 109/L; neutrophils, 55.7%; lymphocytes, 30.2%; total number of lymphocytes, 0.88 × 109/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 35.1 mg/L; potassium, 4.3 mmol/L; sodium, 138 mmol/L; urea, 21 mg/dL; D-dimer, 210 ng/mL; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 52 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 117 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 575 U/L; ferritin, 428 ng/mL; international normalized ratio, 1.07; prothrombin time, 11 minutes; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dL; and direct bilirubin, 0.2 mg/dL.

pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus have been discovered in Wuhan, China, and such cases have spread nationwide quickly. At present, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic. What are the clinical features of this disease? What is the clinical diagnosis and how should such patients be treated? As a clinician, mastery of the clinical characteristics, basic diagnosis, and treatment methods of COVID-19 are required to provide help to patients.          \r\n        Case summary:      \r\n              A 40-some-old patient with a cough lasting 6 d without obvious cause, as well as fever and fatigue for 1 d, was admitted to Hankou Hospital on January 22, 2020 and transferred to Huoshenshan Hospital on February 4. The main clinical symptoms were dry cough, fatigue, and fever. He was diagnosed with COVID-19. From the 4\r\nth\r\n d of admission, the patient's condition gradually worsened, with increased respiratory rate and body temperature. Peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased progressively. On the 8\r\nth\r\n d of admission, the patient's highest temperature was 40.7 °C, and oxygen saturation was 83% despite high-flow oxygen inhalation. Chest computed tomography results showed that the virus progressed rapidly. The number of lesions significantly increased with expanded scope and increased density. The distribution of lesions advanced from peripheral to central. In addition to nasal catheter oxygen inhalation and symptomatic support, antiviral drugs were used throughout the treatment. On January 22, oseltamivir phosphate capsules were given orally (75 mg, twice daily) for 6 d. On January 24, three tablets of lopinavir and ritonavir were added orally (twice daily). After 6 d, this was changed to 0.2 g (two tablets) arbidol, taken orally (three times daily) for 5 d. During the severe stage, methylprednisolone was given (40 mg) once every 12 h, immunoglobulin (20 g) was administered by intravenous drip infusion once daily, and thymosin (1.6 mg) was injected subcutaneously once daily combined with immunotherapy. On February 2, symptoms decreased, various indicators improved, and pulmonary inflammation was obviously reduced. Throat swabs on February 4 and 9 were negative for novel coronavirus nucleic acid. After 19 d in the hospital, the patient was successfully treated and discharged.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              COVID-19 in young adults can be successfully treated with active treatment. We report a typical case of COVID-19, analyze its clinical characteristics, summarize its clinical diagnosis and treatment experience, and provide a reference for clinical colleagues.          \r\n

Usually, after viral pneumonia were clinical cured, the pulmonary lesions of majority patients will gradually be absorbed to complete dissipation, very few severe patients may retain pulmonary interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (1-3). In this case, we described one unique COVID-19 patient, the symptoms were: dry cough, fatigue, poor appetite and subjective fever, moreover, the patient was a non-smoker, had no pulmonary bullous, no history of tuberculosis, and also no hypertension or diabetes. The patient received antiviral therapy, antibacterial therapy, recombinant human interferon-α2a, vitamin C and oxygen inhalation. After two weeks of treatment and observation, the patient was clinical cured and discharged. However, two days later, the patient had a sudden chest stuffiness, CT images indicted: his lung didn't heal like others, but developed a large pulmonary cavity in the lower lobe of right lung.

The virus is highly infectious. Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3\r\n+\r\n T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients.

Since the patient refused admission to the hospital and had stable vital signs, we chose to treat him with a safe anti-inflammatory and non-immunosuppressive therapy. To hit two birds with one stone, we considered colchicine, as it has systemic anti-inflammatory effects and is also effective in gout flare. Unexpectedly, 48 hours after treatment, not only did his ongoing fever and toe pain disappear, he also had significant improvements in his general state of health and all his inflammatory markers including fibrinogen, ferritin, D-dimer, and IL-6 levels normalized. To our knowledge, the use of colchicine in Covid-19 and CRS has not been reported. This observation merits the consideration of colchicine as a safe, inexpensive and oral medication for the treatment of mild to moderate CRS in Covid-19 patients. More importantly, in Covid-19 patients with early lung involvement colchicine may be an appropriate candidate to prevent CRS in adjunction with routine antiviral agents. Indeed, multicenter, randomized controlled studies are required to evaluate the benefits of this therapy.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

We investigated changes in the fecal fungal microbiomes (mycobiome) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and on recovery.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 30 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through May 12, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronovirus; Intestine; Microbe; Yeast.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":30,"article_patient_number":"11","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Hong Kong","country_treated":"Hong Kong","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"hyperlipidemia, left subclavian artery occlusion","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, fever, cough, sputum, dyspnea","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and left subclavian artery occlusion.
