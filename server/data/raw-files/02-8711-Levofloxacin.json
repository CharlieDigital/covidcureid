of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China.

After contacting a public health center on January 25, he was isolated in a negative pressure room at Myongji Hospital and confirmed to have COVID-19 on January 26.\r\n\r\nAt that time the initial confirmation of COVID-19 was made by pan-coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction assay and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons using a throat swab.\r\n\r\nThe index patient transmitted the virus to his friend (patient A) at a restaurant on the 1st day of the symptoms. And then patient A (confirmed on January 30, 2020) transmitted COVID-19 to his spouse and son (confirmed on January 31, 2020), and a church colleague (confirmed on February 6, 2020). Those were the first cases of tertiary transmission of COVID-19 outside China.\r\n\r\nThe index patient was a clothing worker at the Wuhan Fashion Center, with a height of 193 cm and weight of 96 kg (body mass index, 25.7), and had no major illness. He denied any smoking and drinking history.\r\n\r\nOn admission day, he had no respiratory symptoms and blood pressure of 152/93 mmHg, pulse rate of 73 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.0°C. On physical examination, no pharyngeal injection, clear lung sounds, and no haziness on chest X-ray were observed. Tests for Leptospira, Hantan virus, Tsutsugamushi, Malaria, M tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Ag/Ab, and venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test were all negative.\r\n\r\nHe developed fever and dry cough on days 5 and 7 of illness, respectively, but he had no serious respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, productive sputum or chest pain. Small consolidation in right upper lobe and ground-glass opacities in both lower lobes were observed on high-resolution computed tomography scan.\r\n\r\nThe initial viral load could not be measured because real-time PCR was not available when the patient was diagnosed. So we measured viral loads using quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR since Jan. 31, 2020. Viral RNA was extracted from the sputum using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All quantitative real-time PCR amplifications were performed using Quantstudio 1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and PowerCheck™ SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time PCR kit (KogeneBiotech, Seoul, Korea).\r\n\r\nThere were some reports about lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) for the treatment of COVID-19.1\r\nLopinavir/ritonavir was started from the hospital day 8 (day 10 of illness); 2 tablets (lopinavir 200 mg/ritonavir 50 mg) were given per oral bid. Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).  It is possible that the decreased load of SARS-CoV-2 resulted from the natural course of the healing process rather than administration of lopinavir/ritonavir, or both. Therefore, more data need to be collected to figure out the direct effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on treatment with COVID-19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: No\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that symptoms were noted to begin improving: 11\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that full resolution of symptoms was noted: 18\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that patient was discharged if admitted: 19\r\n\r\nJustification for timing of resolution: Admitted on Jan 25, 2020. Lopinavir/ritonavir started on Feb 1, 2020. Discharged on Feb 10, 2020.  Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6675,8711,8783,9640,10547]},{"id":5380,"regimens":[{"id":9966,"duration":{"id":4075,"approximate_duration":"6 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8711,"name":"Levofloxacin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8711","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5736,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9966}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:24.971080Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:10.454933Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5380}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7075,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5380}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":11744,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5380},{"id":11828,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5380},{"id":11829,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5380}],"author_username":"CURE ID Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3197,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5380}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[],"races":[],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:24.957414Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:19:56.764184Z","title":"2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Taiwan: Reports of two cases from Wuhan, China.

Currently, many strict control measures are applied in health care settings, including endoscopy units, in order to limit virus spread. Several recommendations called to limit endoscopic procedures to emergent endoscopies; however, several uncertainties still existing concerning patient safety, protective measures, and infection control methods in emergency endoscopic settings. In this case report, we present a case of successful endoscopic band ligation for bleeding esophageal varices in man with COVID‐19 disease who presented with an acute attack of hematemesis while on mechanical ventilation (MV). Esophago‐ gastroduodenoscopy was performed in the ICU room after preparing the setting, and revealed large, risky esophageal varices. Endoscopic band ligation was done with successful control of bleeding. Third‐level measures of medical protection were applied for the participating medical personnel, and patient monitoring was kept all through the procedure. After the procedure, the bleeding stopped, and the patient was vitally stable and conscious. We conclude that emergency endoscopic interventions could be performed safely with appropriate arrangements in patients with confirmed COVID‐19 on mechanical ventilation.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was

Respiratory droplets and contaction with infected patients are the two major transmission routes. However, the value of tear virus nucleic acid is still not clear. We dynamic detected the SARS-CoV-2 in eye sample of one COVID-19 patient with obstruction of common lacrimal ducts.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              Besides the routine examination, nasopharyngeal and eye swab were continuously measured by polymerase chain reaction assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Gene detection was performed for drug use guidance, and flow cytometry was performed to analyse the lymphocyte subsets.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for 22 days, but eye swabs were still continuously positive for 2 weeks after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative. The low level of lymphocyte and the high level IL-6 lasted for almost 4 weeks, then became near normal. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed the existing of SARS-CoV-2, HSV1 and HHV6B virus nucleic acid. The gene detection for drug use guidance showed the genetic locus ABCB1 (3435T>C) rs1045642 belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir-ritonavir would be significantly decreased. The flow cytometry of lymphocyte subsets showed PD-1\r\n+\r\n CD95\r\n+\r\n cells was accounting for 94.8% in CD3\r\n+\r\n CD8\r\n+\r\n T subset and for 94.8% in CD3\r\n+\r\n TCRγδ\r\n+\r\n T subset.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              As obstruction of common lacrimal duct, positively detection in one eye for 2 weeks more after nasopharyngeal swab became negative. More eye swabs should be collected from COVID-19 patients, especially from those immunocompromised, those with eye symptoms and those had a history of ocular diseases.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":null,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"HSV1 and HHV6B virus nucleic acid were also detected by NGS","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Before discharged, nasopharyngeal swab and eye swab were collected again at the same time.

Thus far, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. The immune system and inflammation are proposed to play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. Intravenous infusion of MSCs has shown promising results in COVID-19 treatment. Here, we report a case of a severe COVID-19 patient treated with human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (hWJCs) from a healthy donor in Liaocheng People's Hospital, China, from February 24, 2020. The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment. After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition. This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"6 days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"According to the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 [14], the patient was treated with antiviral therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, IFN-α inhalation, and also intravenous injection of levofloxacin, tanreqing capsule, xuebijing, thymosin α1, methylprednisolone, and immunoglobulin. During this time, the patient received antipyretic therapy. More treatments were conducted consisting of electrocardiograph monitoring, potassium chloride sustained-release tablets (oral, 1 g per time, 2 times per day), plasma exchange and regulated intestinal microflora of patient, etc. Finally, the discomfort was released, and the oxygen saturation increased to 98%. On February 13 to 21, the patient’s vital physical signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers and shortness of breath.\r\nOn February 22, the patient took a turn for the worse. Considering the severe organ injury caused by an inflammatory response, hWJC adoptive transfer therapy was proposed under the advice and guidance of the specialist group. The family member and patient agreed to try hWJC adoptive transfer therapy. The therapeutic scheme was then discussed and approved by the ethics committee of the hospital, and consent forms were signed by the family member before the therapy. On February 24, the patient receives hWJC transfusion.\r\n\r\nOn March 1, the patient felt much better. The shortness of breath was significantly recovering.

Despite oxygen supplementation and cPAP, however, due to rapid respiratory deterioration in the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the patient was eventually admitted to the ICU and required intubation on February 28. During his stay in the ICU, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and anakinra was maintained, while piperacillin-tazobactam and linezolid were started in place of levofloxacin. In addition, he required vasopressor support with noradrenaline. His clinical conditions progressively improved and, after discontinuing antibiotics on March 3 and invasive mechanical ventilation on March 4, the patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit on March 5.\r\n\r\nOn March 8, after 2 days of diarrhea, the patient complained of abdominal pain and marked distension; at clinical examination, signs of peritoneal irritation were detected. A plain X-ray film and a CT scan showed massive free air in the abdominal cavity, distension of the large bowel, and perforation of the ascending colon. In addition, pulmonary embolism was detected. The patient underwent emergent laparotomy: intraoperative findings included profuse amount of free air, distension of the entire abdominal colon, and a minimal perforation on the anterolateral aspect of the distended cecum.

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

We reduced immunosuppressive regimen in all these patients, typically holding the antiproliferative agent and augmenting steroids; everybody received hydroxychloroquine, initial empiric antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam, and high-dose low molecular weight heparin. Clinical course seemed favorable in three of our patients, but one of them deteriorated after 10 days of hospitalization, probably due to an acute form of graft dysfunction triggered both by COVID-19 and a nosocomial bacterial infection, and eventually died. Although short-term prognosis could be considered benign in the majority of our patients, we should carefully monitor these individuals in order to detect early sign of clinical deterioration and graft dysfunction in the next few months.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Series","number_of_patients":4,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":true,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Cystic Fibrosis post lung transplant on prednisone, tacrolimus and everolimus.

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo. En todos los casos la radiografía de tórax era patológica con infiltrado unilateral o bilateral. La procalcitonina demostró no ser suficientemente sensible para detectar la infección neumocócica. La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida. Los clínicos deben de ser conscientes de la posible asociación de SARS-CoV-2 y neumococo para evitar errores diagnósticos y retrasos en el tratamiento antibiótico.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Coinfección; Diagnosis; Diagnóstico; S. pneumoniae; Tratamiento; Treatment; co-infection.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"3","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Depression","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a history of depression.

transplant, which is known to be mediated by cytotoxic T-cell effectors and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, the lung injury observed in severe COVID-19 cases appears to be related to a massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The selective JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has shown promising results in the context of GVHD, and different trials are currently underway in patients with severe COVID-19; nevertheless, no clinical observation of safety or efficacy of treatment with ruxolitinib in this context has been published yet. We describe a first case of severe COVID-19 developed after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with a concomitant chronic GVHD (cGVHD), in which a treatment with ruxolitinib was administered with good tolerance and positive outcome.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome); COVID-19; chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD); hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT); ruxolitinib.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":null,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"1 year ago underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched sibling brother for high-risk, triple-negative (JAK2, MPL, CALR) myelofibrosis, latent tuberculosis infection","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"He has been receiving ruxolitinib 5 mg bid (offlabel use) for a steroid-refractory, moderate cGVHD with involvement of skin and mouth, achieving a complete response at the time of office visit.\r\nHe was then discharged with a follow-up appointment scheduled 3 months later, confirming ruxolitinib treatment up to the next visit.\r\nTwo weeks later, he presented at the emergency room complaining of fatigue, dry cough, and mild dyspnea.\r\n At hospital admission, ruxolitinib was discontinued, assuming a possible deleterious immunosuppressive activity and delayed viral clearance in a patient with an active viral infection, as previously reported.\r\nThe ongoing therapy with isoniazid and valacyclovir was continued.
