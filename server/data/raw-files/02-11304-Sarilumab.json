On HD #3, his D-dimer was > 10,000 ng/mL (from 501 ng/mL on admission). A heparin infusion was started empirically and titrated to an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.5 IU/mL. With the exception of four anti-Xa levels that were slightly supratherapeutic (0.55–0.73 IU/mL), the level remained within the target range. On HD #5, he was enrolled in a clinical trial and was given sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody, or placebo. His subsequent hospital course was complicated by hypotension with increasing vasopressor requirements and acute kidney injury necessitating initiation of dialysis on HD #10. On HD #13, neurocritical care was consulted due to persistent encephalopathy and concern for absent brainstem reflexes.Non-contrast head CT (NCHCT) demonstrated multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, mass effect, and evidence of global anoxic injury, cerebral edema, and downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils. Given his grave prognosis, the family decided to make the patient DNR, and the patient died on HD
