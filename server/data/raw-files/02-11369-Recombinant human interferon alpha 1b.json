Only the husband and wife contracted COVID. The daughter's tests remained negative.\r\nSix days after the start of the treatment regimen, the patient once again had a fever, cough, sore throat, and tonsil enlargement. The patient was diagnosed with tonsillitis and treated with Aztreonam. Five days later, patient symptoms improved, and she maintained normal body temperature. The patient's oropharyngeal swab test for COVID became negative.\r\n\r\nAfter admission, the patient received antiviral treatment, including lopinavir (Kaletra®, 400 mg, q12h, po),  Arbidol (Manuosu®, 0.2  g, tid, po) and Lianhua Qingwen capsule (Chinese medicine, 6g, tid, po) and recombinant human interferon (5 million iu Bid nebulization). On day 5 of her hospital stay, the patient’s body  temperature returned to within normal range, but she reported that she had shortness of breath and chest depression. The chest CT on that same day showed multiple patchy ground-glass opacities in the upper and lower lobes of both lungs.\r\n\r\nOn day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Oseltamivir  (kewei®75mg, bid, po) and Yinlianjiedutang (Chinese medicine) were added to her antiviral  treatment.  On hospital day 16, the patient’s symptoms improved and supplemental oxygen was discontinued. The previously-observed patchy ground-glass opacities in the chest CT were no longer present.\r\n\r\nHowever, the patient’s oropharyngeal swab test for SAR-CoV-2 was still positive. On hospital day  23, the patient’s body temperature elevated to 37.7°C. The therapeutic scheme was changed to ribavirin,    hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and Qingfeipaidutang (Chinese medicine).","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342,11385,8782,11313,11369,10130,10942]}]
