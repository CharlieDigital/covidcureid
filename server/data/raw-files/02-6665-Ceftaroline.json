populations emphasized a mild course of disease with severe cases disproportionately affecting infant and comorbid pediatric patients. After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by a SARS-CoV-2-positive female child who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal dysfunction and fluid-refractory hypotension requiring vasopressors and PICU admission.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Child; Coronavirus; Enoxaparin; Pediatric;

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo. En todos los casos la radiografía de tórax era patológica con infiltrado unilateral o bilateral. La procalcitonina demostró no ser suficientemente sensible para detectar la infección neumocócica. La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida. Los clínicos deben de ser conscientes de la posible asociación de SARS-CoV-2 y neumococo para evitar errores diagnósticos y retrasos en el tratamiento antibiótico.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Coinfección; Diagnosis; Diagnóstico; S. pneumoniae; Tratamiento; Treatment; co-infection.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"Yes","age":"81-89 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Ischemic Heart Disease\r\nAortic Stenosis","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including diabetes, hypertension (treated with ARBs), Ischemic heart disease, aortic stenosis, and chronic kidney disease.
