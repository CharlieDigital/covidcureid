Severe COVID‐19 patients present with increased inflammatory markers, akin to secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), that have been shown to predict mortality. There is emerging evidence for the use of an interleukin (IL‐6) inhibitor, tocilizumab (TCZ), for suppression of the inflammatory cytokine storm in this context. Ruxolitinib (RXB), a JAK‐STAT inhibitor, has also been shown to have proven efficacy in the treatment of sHLH. Both agents appear to be promising in the fight against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, leading to an increasing number of trials being registered with their use.

Severe COVID‐19 patients present with increased inflammatory markers, akin to secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), that have been shown to predict mortality. There is emerging evidence for the use of an interleukin 6 (IL‐6) inhibitor, tocilizumab (TCZ), for suppression of the inflammatory cytokine storm in this context. Ruxolitinib (RXB), a JAK‐STAT inhibitor, has also been shown to have proven efficacy in the treatment of sHLH.
