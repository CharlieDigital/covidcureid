We report our case series of 6 KTs with COVID-19 pneumonia who received TCZ: All were of male gender, with a mean age of 55.5 ± 8.4 years, a median time from transplantation of 3611 days (1465-5757); 5/6 had cardiovascular comorbidities, 1/6 had diabetes, and 3/6 have one or more previous KTs. Four out of six patients died, at an average time of 9.75 ± 2.4 days after tocilizumab administration, 3/6 due to a coexistent septic shock. Two patients improved after TCZ and were discharged at 20 and 21 days, respectively; in both patient, a significant increase of total lymphocyte count was observed. In conclusion, KTs, where the role of peculiar factors such as chronic immunosuppression is still undetermined, represent a high-risk group with significant COVID-19-associated mortality. The evaluation of the TCZ effect in COVID-19 pneumonia requires controlled studies (ideally RCTs) in this specific population.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Tocilizumab; kidney transplant.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":6,"article_patient_number":"5","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"12 days after discharge","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient receieved a kidney transplant 18 years ago.
