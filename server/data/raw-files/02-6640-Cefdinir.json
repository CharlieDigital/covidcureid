Since he was confirmed to be infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (5 g/d) for 2 days in the outpatient clinic. After the infusion ended, he was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring for clinical condition online by the local community health workers.
