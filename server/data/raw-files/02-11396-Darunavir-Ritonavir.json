It is unclear whether solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe complications and how they should be managed, also concerning immunosuppression. This is a report about the course and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients from a single center in Northwestern Italy in the period March-April 2020. Three patients who were treated at our institution are reported in detail, whereas summary data are provided for those managed at peripheral Hospitals. Presentation varied from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, treatment and changes to immunosuppression were adapted to the severity of the disease. Overall mortality was 20%, whereas Covid-related mortality was 10%. Two cases of prolonged (>2 months) viral carriage were observed in two asymptomatic patients who contracted the infection in the early course after transplant. Besides depicting Covid-19 course and possible treatment scenarios in liver transplant patients, these cases are discussed in relation to the changes in our practice prompted by Covid-19 epidemic, with potential implications for other transplant programs.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; early infection; immunosuppression; viral carriage.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":10,"article_patient_number":"8","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":true,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"","clinical_syndrome":"fever","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient had received a liver transplant prior to COVID-19 diagnosis.

Social distancing measures were needed to reduce transmission, and lockdown included restricted access to health care facilities. The impact of COVID-19 on transplant recipients is unknown, but considering their immunosuppression status and associated comorbidities, they should be considered a high-risk population.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            A kidney transplant center in Central Italy implemented a strategy to maintain follow-up of kidney transplant recipients by phone and e-mail during lockdown. Telephone interviews were used to administer a clinical questionnaire to patients, and e-mail was used to receive the results of diagnostic tests conducted in outpatient settings.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            From March 17 to April 23, 2020, a total of 143 kidney transplant recipients were contacted. Twenty-eight patients needed in-hospital consultation for problems unrelated to COVID-19, 3 of whom needed hospitalization. Eleven patients were managed at home for mild urinary or respiratory diseases, and 1 was referred to the hematologist. We identified 2 suspected cases of COVID-19 infection, and the patients were referred to hospital care. Immunosuppressive therapy was modulated, and intravenous corticosteroids and potentially effective antiviral therapy were administered with a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Conclusions:        \r\n            In the context of a lockdown, such as that occurring in response to COVID-19, we suggest implementing remote surveillance programs in kidney transplant recipients with the help of any available technology and offering medical consulting and logistic support as needed.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":true,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Obesity, history of kidney transplant","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Kidney function remained stable during hospitalization, with a serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 36 mL/min/1.73 m2.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[11396]}]
