of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China.

After contacting a public health center on January 25, he was isolated in a negative pressure room at Myongji Hospital and confirmed to have COVID-19 on January 26.\r\n\r\nAt that time the initial confirmation of COVID-19 was made by pan-coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction assay and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons using a throat swab.\r\n\r\nThe index patient transmitted the virus to his friend (patient A) at a restaurant on the 1st day of the symptoms. And then patient A (confirmed on January 30, 2020) transmitted COVID-19 to his spouse and son (confirmed on January 31, 2020), and a church colleague (confirmed on February 6, 2020). Those were the first cases of tertiary transmission of COVID-19 outside China.\r\n\r\nThe index patient was a clothing worker at the Wuhan Fashion Center, with a height of 193 cm and weight of 96 kg (body mass index, 25.7), and had no major illness. He denied any smoking and drinking history.\r\n\r\nOn admission day, he had no respiratory symptoms and blood pressure of 152/93 mmHg, pulse rate of 73 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.0°C. On physical examination, no pharyngeal injection, clear lung sounds, and no haziness on chest X-ray were observed. Tests for Leptospira, Hantan virus, Tsutsugamushi, Malaria, M tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Ag/Ab, and venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test were all negative.\r\n\r\nHe developed fever and dry cough on days 5 and 7 of illness, respectively, but he had no serious respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, productive sputum or chest pain. Small consolidation in right upper lobe and ground-glass opacities in both lower lobes were observed on high-resolution computed tomography scan.\r\n\r\nThe initial viral load could not be measured because real-time PCR was not available when the patient was diagnosed. So we measured viral loads using quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR since Jan. 31, 2020. Viral RNA was extracted from the sputum using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All quantitative real-time PCR amplifications were performed using Quantstudio 1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and PowerCheck™ SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time PCR kit (KogeneBiotech, Seoul, Korea).\r\n\r\nThere were some reports about lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) for the treatment of COVID-19.1\r\nLopinavir/ritonavir was started from the hospital day 8 (day 10 of illness); 2 tablets (lopinavir 200 mg/ritonavir 50 mg) were given per oral bid. Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).  It is possible that the decreased load of SARS-CoV-2 resulted from the natural course of the healing process rather than administration of lopinavir/ritonavir, or both. Therefore, more data need to be collected to figure out the direct effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on treatment with COVID-19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: No\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that symptoms were noted to begin improving: 11\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that full resolution of symptoms was noted: 18\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that patient was discharged if admitted: 19\r\n\r\nJustification for timing of resolution: Admitted on Jan 25, 2020. Lopinavir/ritonavir started on Feb 1, 2020. Discharged on Feb 10, 2020.  Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6675,8711,8783,9640,10547]},{"id":5516,"regimens":[{"id":10287,"duration":{"id":4254,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6131,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10287},{"id":6132,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10287}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:41:00.950358Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.635450Z","dose":"200 mg x 2","frequency":"BD","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5516},{"id":10288,"duration":{"id":4255,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":7166,"name":"Darunavir-Cobicistat","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/7166","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6133,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10288},{"id":6134,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10288}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:41:00.958865Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.642406Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5516},{"id":10289,"duration":{"id":542,"approximate_duration":"","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":6675,"name":"Ceftriaxone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6675","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6135,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10289},{"id":6136,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10289}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:54:22.418355Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.648812Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5516},{"id":10290,"duration":{"id":466,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6137,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10290},{"id":6138,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10290}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:54:22.423472Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.655168Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5516}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7261,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5516},{"id":7262,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5516},{"id":7263,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5516}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":12057,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5516},{"id":12058,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5516},{"id":12059,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5516}],"author_username":"Parvesh Paul","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.","author_country":"India","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3338,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5516}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":29,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:39:53.704400Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.626306Z","title":"Benign COVID-19 in an immunocompromised cancer patient -  the case of a married couple.

A married couple (age 60 years) was simultaneously admitted to the emergency department on 10 March 2020 because of dyspnoea and fever, consistent with COVID-19. The wife (patient 1) was partially immunocompromised as a consequence of a recently started chemotherapy with fulvestrant and abemaciclid for recurring breast cancer, her husband (patient 2) had been healthy except for a history of controlled arterial hypertension. Both patients were treated with darunavir/cobicistat and hydroxychloroquine. The clinical course of the immunocompromised partner was benign, without need of intensive care. She was able to leave the hospital on day 6 after admission. In contrast, her husband needed intensive care and his recovery was slow, although eventually successful too. These findings suggest that the course of COVID-19 is not necessarily ominous in the presence of a compromised immune response and tend to reinforce the emerging therapeutic concepts of a controlled mitigation of the immune cascade following SARS CoV-2 infection.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Arterial hypertension, controlled with losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.\r\n\r\nThe son tested positive for COVID-19 on 10 March 2020, was asymptomatic at that time and sent home into quarantine.

All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab. Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers. Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":4,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"The treatment scheme was:\r\nlopinavir 800 mg/day + ritonavir 200 mg/day, vitamin C6 g/day for 4 days + hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day + eculizumab 900 mg 2 doses, enoxaparin 4000 IU/day subcutaneous, CPAP (NIV) + ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV.

and rapid sharing of the isolate.\r\n\r\nSetting: SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a 58-year-old man from Wuhan, China who arrived in Melbourne on 19 January 2020 and was admitted to the Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne from the emergency department on 24 January 2020 with fever, cough, and progressive dyspnoea.\r\n\r\nMajor outcomes: Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient.\r\n\r\nResults: A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum collected when the patient presented to hospital were each positive for SARS-CoV-2 (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in culture. Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae. Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\r\n\r\nObjective: To describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\r\n\r\nStudy design: We describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\r\n\r\nResults: Among 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).\r\n\r\nConclusion: We report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"5","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"A 30- to 34-year-old previously healthy gravida at 36 0/7 weeks’ gestation was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and gestational diabetes.","pregnant":true,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"A 30- to 34-year-old previously healthy gravida at 36 0/7 weeks’ gestation was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and initiated on ceftriaxone, oseltamivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir.

Given the exacerbation of the patient's symptoms, empirical IVIG (20 g) and thymalfasin were initiated. Corticosteroids (80 mg intravenous methylprednisolone) were also commenced, which was halved to 40 mg two days later.  Ceftriaxone was replaced with piperacillin/tazobactam (4.5 g intravenously every 8 h) based on the symptom deterioration and increased serum CRP (35.09 mg/L)administration of three consecutive sessions of PE was initiated with 6000 mL of plasma (frozen plasma served as the sole replacement solution) followed by 20 g of IVIG from DOI 14 to DOI 17. The patient's symptoms were almost all alleviated following three consecutive sessions of PE treatment. No adverse events or complications were observed during PE treatment.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6675,8462,8783,9077,9780,11327]},{"id":5879,"regimens":[{"id":10982,"duration":{"id":5040,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7270,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10982},{"id":7271,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10982}],"created":"2020-09-10T20:46:08.250198Z","updated":"2020-10-01T19:48:55.524417Z","dose":"500 mg","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5879},{"id":10983,"duration":{"id":5041,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6675,"name":"Ceftriaxone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6675","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7272,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10983},{"id":7273,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10983}],"created":"2020-09-10T20:46:08.258382Z","updated":"2020-10-01T19:48:55.530724Z","dose":"2 g","frequency":"","route":"IV","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5879}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13075,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5879},{"id":13076,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5879}],"author_username":"CURE ID Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3808,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5879},{"id":3809,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":5879}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-09-10T20:45:18.839372Z","updated":"2020-10-01T19:48:55.516289Z","title":"SARS-CoV-2 and Legionella co-infection in a person returning from a Nile cruise.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32297939,"doi":"10.1093/jtm/taaa053","article_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32297939","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Arashiro T\r\nNakamura S\r\nAsami T\r\nMikuni H\r\nFujiwara E\r\nSakamoto S\r\nMiura R\r\nShionoya Y\r\nHonda R\r\nFurukawa K\r\nNakamura A\r\nSaito H","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"Journal of travel medicine","abstract":"We report a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Legionella co-infection manifesting as pneumonia with gastrointestinal symptoms.

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. \r\nInfluenza B\r\n, human coronavirus 229E, \r\nStaphylococcus aureus\r\n and \r\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\r\n were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. \r\nInfluenza B\r\n and \r\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\r\n were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient's condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Case report; Coronavirus; Manila; Philippines; SARS-CoV-2.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"Philippines","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient tested positive for Influenza B viral RNA and Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA.

He presented initially with vague gastrointerestinal symptoms and\r\nlater a cough. His atypical presentation led to a delay in diagnosis, but ultimately he was isolated and tested. On confirming\r\nthe diagnosis of COVID-19, the patient was isolated in a separate hospital with a dedicated medical care team. All\r\ncontacts were traced and quarantined.

There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              When the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS-CoV-2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms that could be a manifestation of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions. Both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, and anorexia and associated with elevation of CRP and ferritin, but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              Our report suggests that XLA patients might present with high risk to develop pneumonia after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but can recover from infection, suggesting that B-cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease. However, there is a need for larger observational studies to extend these conclusions to other patients with similar genetic immune defects.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Agammaglobulinemia - regular intravenous immunoglobulin infusions every 28 days and stayed in good health","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6675,8342,8412]},{"id":5939,"regimens":[{"id":11118,"duration":{"id":5177,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7476,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11118},{"id":8365,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11118}],"created":"2020-09-16T17:57:10.082469Z","updated":"2020-10-01T06:04:48.598959Z","dose":"200mg/50mg","frequency":"2 capsules BID","route":"PO","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5939},{"id":11119,"duration":{"id":5178,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7477,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11119},{"id":8366,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11119}],"created":"2020-09-16T17:57:10.089956Z","updated":"2020-10-01T06:04:48.605267Z","dose":"200 mg","frequency":"BID","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5939},{"id":11120,"duration":{"id":5179,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6675,"name":"Ceftriaxone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6675","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7478,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11120},{"id":8367,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11120}],"created":"2020-09-16T17:57:10.096128Z","updated":"2020-10-01T06:04:48.611119Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5939}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7778,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5939}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13238,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5939},{"id":13239,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5939}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3881,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5939}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-09-16T17:55:15.412426Z","updated":"2020-10-01T06:04:48.591295Z","title":"A possible role for B cells in COVID-19?

pandemic requires extra attention for immunocompromised patients, including solid organ transplant recipients. We report on a case of a  renal transplant recipient in 30s who suffered from a severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical course was complicated by extreme overexposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following coadministration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options. However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy. With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Netherlands","country_treated":"Netherlands","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"This case demonstrates important clinical and pharmacokinetic aspects that play a role in renal transplant recipients with COVID‐19.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"The patient was a renal transplant pt who since transplantation, has been receiving dual maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with everolimus (3 mg BID) and prednisolone (7.5 mg QD), with a stable serum creatinine of around 1.8 mg/dL, an estimated glomerular filtration rate  of 49 mL/min/1.73m2 without albuminuria. After testing positive for Covid-oxygen was given by nasal cannula and IV cefuroxime was started. Directly after assessing his QTc time, oral chloroquine (300 mg BID after 600 mg loading dose) and combination antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg BID) were initiated.Considering interactions with lopinavir/ritonavir, the everolimus dose was reduced from 3 to 2 mg BID. Cefuroxime was replaced by ceftriaxone as part of selective colonic decontamination, which is standard Dutch ICU protocol for intubated patients with expected duration of >24 hours or admission >48 hours. Pt was discharged to the inpatient clinic, but his renal function and respiratory status deteriorated so he was transferred to the transplant center. Lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine, which he had for 4 days, were ceased; antibiotics were continued; and loop diuretics were initiated.

Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given (2 g/kg) with aspirin (75 mg once-a-day). Echocardiogram did not show any abnormalities and repeat chest Xray showed increased right-sided infiltrates. Repeat nasopharyngeal COVID-19 RT-PCR was positive. Multiplex PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirate detected Coronavirus OC43 and Human Rhino/Enterovirus. As he improved, he was gradually weaned off HFNC. Blood cultures showed no growth and antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. In light of the persistent high-grade fever and elevated CRP (121 mg/L), 72 hours after IVIG infusion, he was given tocilizumab (8 mg/kg IV over 2 hours). Twelve hours later, his fever spikes settled, and inflammatory parameters rapidly decreased to baseline.

On presentation, her physical examination was benign, except for sinus tachycardia, and she was oxygenating adequately on room air. Laboratory studies were unremarkable, except a PCR test positive for SARS-COV2, and a CT scan of her chest showed bilateral multi-focal ground-glass opacities. A fetal non-stress test was reassuring. She was treated with intravenous fluids, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine. During her hospital stay, she developed progressively worsening respiratory failure, initially requiring non-invasive ventilation, and subsequently progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. She then suffered from sudden hypoxemia and hemodynamic collapse, on maximal ventilatory support, prompting an emergency cesarean section at bedside. This led to rapid stabilization of hemodynamic parameters, and of her overall respiratory status.

Case 1: A 46-year-old-man with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 infection was being administered favipiravir. Fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium were also given. On day 3, midazolam administration was initiated for deep sedation. On day 5, his high body temperature increased to 41.2 °C, creatine kinase level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS was suspected, and supportive therapy was initiated. High-grade fever persisted for 4 days and subsided on day 9. Case 2: A 44-year-old-man with ARDS caused by COVID-19 infection was being treated with favipiravir. On day 5, risperidone was started for delirium. On day 7, his body temperature suddenly increased to 40.8 °C, his CK level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS diagnosis was confirmed, and both, favipiravir and risperidone were discontinued on day 8. On the same day, his CK levels decreased, and his body temperature normalized on day 9. Patients with COVID-19 infection frequently require deep sedation and develop delirium; therefore, more attention should be paid to the development of NMS in patients who are being administered such causative agents.

Her initial chest radiography was abnormal, and her first sputum SARS-CoV-2 test yielded inconclusive results. A subsequent sputum test was positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Her chest radiography (CXR) revealed an alveolar opacity in the left middle lung field. Thus, a diagnosis of pneumonia probably due to COVID-19 was made. She was admitted to an airborne infection isolation room, and empirical treatments were started with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. Initial blood tests apart from mild leukopenia showed no other abnormalities. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of sputum obtained on day 1 of admission was inconclusive for SARS-CoV-2, but sputum obtained on day 4 of admission was positive.4 Furthermore, she started to develop sore throat, mild cough, and diarrhea on day 3 of admission.

countries rapidly. We report the first case of meningitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 who was brought in by ambulance due to a convulsion accompanied by unconsciousness. He had never been to any foreign countries. He felt generalized fatigue and fever (day 1). He saw doctors nearby twice (day 2 and 5) and was prescribed Laninamivir and antipyretic agents, His family visited his home and found that he was unconsciousness and lying on the floor in his vomit. He was immediately transported to this hospital by ambulance (day 9). Under emergency transport, he had transient generalized seizures that lasted about a minute. He had obvious neck stiffness. The specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab but was detected in a CSF. Anti- HSV 1 and varicella-zoster IgM antibodies were not detected in serum samples. A brain MRI showed hyperintensity along the wall of right lateral ventricle and hyperintense signal changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus, suggesting the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 meningitis.

rates of mortality in older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurologic disease which requires long-term treatment with immunotherapies that have been shown to increase the risk of infections. As a result, there is significant anxiety among patients and neurologists during the pandemic regarding the infection outcome in this patient population.

ventilation. While increased sputum secretion could cause airway obstruction during mechanical ventilation, there are few reported cases in the literature. We report a case of a 65-year-old man with diabetes and severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, nafamostat, and prone positioning. Initially, mechanical ventilation consisted of a heat moisture exchanger, endotracheal tube aspiration, and subglottic secretion drainage using a closed suction system. However, endotracheal tube impaction by highly viscous sputum occurred during this mechanical ventilation system. Replacing the endotracheal tube, the use of a humidifier instead of a heat moisture exchanger, and prone positioning contributed to the patient being weaned off mechanical ventilation. Although anti-aerosol measures are important for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, attention should be given to potential endotracheal tube impaction during mechanical ventilation.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  coronavirus 2019 (covid-19); coronavirus disease 2019; covid-19 respiratory failure high altitude pulmonary edema high flow nasal cannula acute respiratory distress syndrome; invasive mechanical ventilation; key words corona; sars cov-2; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2); tube impaction.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Continuation of mechanical ventilation proved difficult after endotracheal tube impaction with highly viscous sputum.

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo. En todos los casos la radiografía de tórax era patológica con infiltrado unilateral o bilateral. La procalcitonina demostró no ser suficientemente sensible para detectar la infección neumocócica. La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida. Los clínicos deben de ser conscientes de la posible asociación de SARS-CoV-2 y neumococo para evitar errores diagnósticos y retrasos en el tratamiento antibiótico.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Coinfección; Diagnosis; Diagnóstico; S. pneumoniae; Tratamiento; Treatment; co-infection.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"Yes","age":"81-89 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Ischemic Heart Disease\r\nAortic Stenosis","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including diabetes, hypertension (treated with ARBs), Ischemic heart disease, aortic stenosis, and chronic kidney disease.

A male in his 70s developed dysphagia and consequent aspiration pneumonia during recovery from severe COVID-19. He had altered sense of taste and absent gag reflex. Videoendoscopy, videofluorography, and high-resolution manometry revealed impaired pharyngolaryngeal sensation, silent aspiration, and mesopharyngeal contractile dysfunction.

The virus is highly infectious. Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3\r\n+\r\n T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients.

They subsequently received pulse therapy with methylprednisolone [1,000 mg/day intravenously (IV) for three consecutive days] and IV immunoglobulin (20 g/day). This treatment regimen was associated with a prompt resolution of respiratory failure, elimination of clinical manifestations of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and reversal of pulmonary CT changes. The treatment was generally safe and well-tolerated. There was no evidence of protracted persistence of the virus in the patients. Further randomized controlled trials are required to better understand the efficacy and safety of high-dose methylprednisolone and IV immunoglobulin, separately or in combination with each other, in the treatment of severe, life-threatening COVID-19.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  corticosteroids; covid-19; cytokine release syndrome; immunoglobulin; methylprednisolone;

throughout a patient's lifetime. Moreover, viral pathogens have been proven to be the leading contributors to myopericarditis in the pediatric and adult populations. Despite the current comprehensive knowledge of myocardial injury in viral and post-viral myopericarditis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced myopericarditis are poorly understood. This report presents a case of coronavirus (COVID-19) fulminant myopericarditis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a middle-aged male patient: a 50-SOME-old man with a history of hypertension who arrived to the emergency department with a dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, resulting in the patient's admission to the airborne isolation unit for clinical observation. When his condition began to deteriorate, the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit after electrocardiography detected cardiac injury, demonstrating diffuse ST-segment elevation. Laboratory evaluations revealed elevated troponin T and BNP, with an echocardiogram indicating global left ventricular hypokinesia and a reduced ejection fraction. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dobutamine, remdesivir, and ventilatory support. This specific case highlights the severity and complications that may arise as a direct result of COVID-19 infection.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  ards; coronavirus

He was intubated and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia-associated respiratory failure. Ambrisentan and tadalafil were continued for pulmonary hypertension. He was given ceftriaxone intravenously and inhaled nitric oxide with improved oxygen saturation. He also received a dose of tocilizumab as part of a clinical trial.

During hospitalization, he received a tracheostomy and has since been discharged home on tracheostomy collar by day and night time CPAP.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6675,8342,10776]},{"id":6630,"regimens":[{"id":13231,"duration":{"id":7121,"approximate_duration":"5 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":11379,"name":"Baricitinib","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11379","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11608,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13231},{"id":11609,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13231}],"created":"2020-12-01T01:47:38.429573Z","updated":"2020-12-02T21:42:47.045724Z","dose":"2 mg","frequency":"QD","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6630},{"id":13232,"duration":{"id":7122,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11610,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13232},{"id":11611,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13232}],"created":"2020-12-01T01:47:38.436800Z","updated":"2020-12-02T21:42:47.051983Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6630},{"id":13233,"duration":{"id":7123,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6675,"name":"Ceftriaxone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6675","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11612,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13233},{"id":11613,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13233}],"created":"2020-12-01T01:47:38.443355Z","updated":"2020-12-02T21:42:47.057436Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6630},{"id":13234,"duration":{"id":7124,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11614,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13234},{"id":11615,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13234}],"created":"2020-12-01T01:47:38.450235Z","updated":"2020-12-02T21:42:47.063214Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6630}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8695,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6630}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14947,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6630},{"id":14948,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6630}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4810,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6630}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-12-01T01:45:38.674083Z","updated":"2020-12-02T21:42:47.037901Z","title":"Use of Baricitinib in Patients with Moderate and Severe COVID-19.

We investigated changes in the fecal fungal microbiomes (mycobiome) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and on recovery.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 30 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through May 12, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls.

Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronovirus; Intestine; Microbe; Yeast.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":30,"article_patient_number":"11","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Hong Kong","country_treated":"Hong Kong","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"hyperlipidemia, left subclavian artery occlusion","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, fever, cough, sputum, dyspnea","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and left subclavian artery occlusion.

We investigated changes in the fecal fungal microbiomes (mycobiome) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and on recovery.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 30 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through May 12, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n

Clinical presentations were similar with fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal complaints, and/or rash. One patient had altered mental status with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings consistent with aseptic meningitis. Laboratory values were remarkable for high levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimers, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin in all patients. All had low albumin levels. Evaluation for other infectious etiologies was negative. All of the patients were critically ill, requiring admission to the intensive care unit. All had circulatory shock and needed inotropes. Two patients had respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support and one had cardiac dysfunction. All patients received steroids, and two received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). One patient received tocilizumab. None of the children died.

All patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and were previously healthy. Clinical presentations were similar with fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal complaints, and/or rash. One patient had altered mental status with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings consistent with aseptic meningitis. Laboratory values were remarkable for high levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimers, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin in all patients. All had low albumin levels. Evaluation for other infectious etiologies was negative. All of the patients were critically ill, requiring admission to the intensive care unit. All had circulatory shock and needed inotropes. Two patients had respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support and one had cardiac dysfunction. All patients received steroids, and two received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). One patient received tocilizumab. None of the children died. MIS-C is a recently recognized pediatric illness spectrum in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical characterization is essential for understanding disease mechanisms to inform clinical

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals.

Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the clinical course and the therapeutic management of patients with chronic kidney disease and COVID-19 infection. To date, most evidence has come from renal transplantation, with about 45 patients reported thus far, and the current data from the ERA-EDTA (ERACODA) registry for transplanted patients and patients on Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT); as for those with glomerular diseases, data are lacking. Herein, we report the case of a 62-year-old patient with severe membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis who had been receiving a high burden of immunosuppression until four months before the COVID-19 infection. He developed severe disease with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. After treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, despite his low chances, he gradually recovered and survived. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few reported patients with glomerulonephritis who had COVID-19 Besides our single case with glomerulonephritis early during the disease outbreak, the very low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the country's transplant recipients (0.038%) and dialysis patients (0.24%) reflects the impact of the rapid implementation of social distancing rules as well as of preventive measures for disease control in the hospitals and dialysis units in our country.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Greece","country_treated":"Greece","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"25 days after hospitalization","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Remdesivir was not administered because of renal impairment (peak creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL, corresponding to an eGFR of 23 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the CKD-EPI equation).
