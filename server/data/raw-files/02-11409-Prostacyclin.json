40-some-old man diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) who developed extensive pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas in conjunction with an acute abdomen during the recovery phase of his acute lung injury. A non-surgical conservative approach was taken as the definitive surgical procedure; a complete small-bowel resection was deemed to be associated with an unacceptably high long-term morbidity. However, repeat computed tomography four days later showed complete resolution of the original computed tomography findings. Pneumatosis intestinalis from non-ischaemic origins has been described in association with norovirus and cytomegalovirus. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this has been described in COVID-19.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Mesenteric ischaemia; Pneumatosis intestinalis; SARS-CoV-2.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Ireland","country_treated":"Ireland","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Anxiety on fluoxetine, Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, obesity - BMI=31","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, Intestinal Bowels","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, diarrhea, vomiting, diffuse small bowel distension, pneumatosis, portal venous gas","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"This case highlights an unusual association between active SARS-CoV-2 infection and a computed tomography (CT) appearance that mimics extensive mesenteric ischaemia.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient had been on treatment for anxiety with fluoxetine.\r\n\r\nA surgical opinion was sought.
