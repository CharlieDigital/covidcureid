with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been successively reported globally. Studies show clear person-to-person transmission. The average incubation period is 2-14 days, and mostly 3-7 days. However, in some patients, this period may be longer. Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 where a woman  in her 40s with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14-day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan. Almost at the same time, her father and sister were diagnosed with COVID-19. The results suggest that the long-term use of glucocorticoids might cause atypical infections, a long incubation period, and extra transmission of COVID-19.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Series","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"81-89 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":true,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5745,5839,11339,7921,11149,8459,8745,8783,8971,9463,9780,9912,10130]}]
