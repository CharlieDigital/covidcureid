outbreak of respiratory illness termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 that has affected >0.8 million individuals. Self-limiting respiratory tract involvement, severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure and death are the spectrum of COVID-19. To date, there are no especial therapeutic agents for COVID-19 infections. One such medication includes the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which recently reported as a possible therapy for shortening the duration of COVID-19 symptoms, reducing inflammatory reactions to infection, impairing the exacerbation of pneumonia and boosting lung imaging findings. Like all medications, HCQ has side effects and may occur in COVID-19 patients. Here, we report on the case of a 40-some-old woman, presented with fever and dry cough, who had COVID-19 and 2 days later presented with a pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash, which started from the distal of upper extremities and rapidly, involved the entire body.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, Skin","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection, fever, dry cough, maculopapular rash and flat atypical targets diagnosed as Stevens-Johnson syndrome","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"A diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome as an adverse event of Hydroxychloroquine treatment for COVID-19.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"After two days of Hydroxychloroquine treatment , the patient presented with a pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash and flat atypical targets that started fromthe distal of upper extremities, rapidly involved the entire body and torn blisters that were only be seen as ulcers on orolabial area.\r\n\r\nThis adverse event was diagnosed as Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS).","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient was discharged after five days with nonpruritic scalded skin on the distal of upper extremities","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5600,7425,8342,8783,8787]}]
