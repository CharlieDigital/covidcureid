On January 17, 2020, the patient presented a feeling of general malaise and coldness. On January 19, she had fever with body temperature of 37.3 °C and experienced diarrhea and vomiting. She started to receive intravenous injection of cefotaxime in community clinic and took oral Jinyebaidu granules (another Chinese traditional patent medicine) and oseltamivir\r\n(75 mg, twice a day) for 4 days. She had persistent severe fever with body temperature from 37.6 °C to\r\n38.3 °C for four days. On January 23, her chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple patchy ground glass opacity and consolidation shadow in bilateral lung and sub-pleural regions.  She was highly suspected with COVID-19.  Oral moxifloxacin and arbidol were prescribed, and she continued to take Jinyebaidu granules and oseltamivir. On January 24, her body temperature reached 39.9 °C and experienced severe fatigue, diarrhea, and breathlessness despite continuous treatments of the above drugs. She felt better after intravenous injection of immunoglobin (IVIG, 5 g per day) and dexamethasone (5 mg, once to twice a day). However, the patient experienced recurrent fever (body temperature of 39 °C) and breathlessness, and her blood oxygen saturation fluctuated from 90% to 95% at the night of January 27. On January 28, the second chest CT scan indicated that her pneumonia aggravated for the past 5 days (Fig. 1B). A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was obtained and sent for detection of 2019-nCoV. Although the patient’s 2019-nCoV test was negative (Table 1), she was diagnosed of COVID-19 in accordance with her symptoms and chest CT display. On the same day, she was confined into an isolation ward and started to take oral SHL (twice a day, 20 mL once). On the next day, SHL administration increased to three times a day (20 mL once) without using any other drugs. From January 29 to 31, the patient’s symptoms resolved with body temperature decreasing from 37.3 °C to 36.5 °C and without vomiting and diarrhea. The patient gradually felt strong except for slight cough. After February 6, the patient’s symptoms disappeared, and her third chest CT scan (Fig. 1C) showed significant absorption of bilateral ground glass opacity compared with the previous ones.\r\n\r\nEver on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: No","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[7230,8412,9197,11307,10942]},{"id":5381,"regimens":[{"id":9967,"duration":{"id":4076,"approximate_duration":"3 days (Hospital day 6-9)","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":6642,"name":"Cefepime","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6642","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5737,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9967},{"id":5738,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":9967}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:24.986349Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:18.845285Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"IV","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5381},{"id":9968,"duration":{"id":4077,"approximate_duration":"3 days (Hospital day 6-9)","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":6916,"name":"Clarithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6916","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5739,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9968},{"id":5740,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":9968}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:24.991800Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:18.848057Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"Oral","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5381},{"id":9969,"duration":{"id":4078,"approximate_duration":"Unknown (Hospital Day 9 onwards)","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":9197,"name":"Moxifloxacin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9197","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5741,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9969}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:24.997279Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:10.460409Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"Oral","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5381}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7076,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5381}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":11745,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5381},{"id":11830,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5381},{"id":11831,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5381}],"author_username":"CURE ID Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3198,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5381}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[],"races":[],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:24.973926Z","updated":"2020-05-01T13:06:28.662384Z","title":"2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Taiwan: Reports of two cases from Wuhan, China.

  The first case of pneumonia subsequently attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province on December 8, 2019. The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties. A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus.          \r\n        Case summary:      \r\n              A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea. She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties. A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs. The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years. Her blood pressure was well controlled. On January 9, 2020, the patient's son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17. The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out. A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia. Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19.

We present a 2019-nCoV patient with the onset of simple dizziness, accompanied by dry throat, no fever, no cough, no headache, no mental abnormality, and no obvious abnormality in the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. Meanwhile, chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple small spot shadows and interstitial changes in the early stage, especially in the extrapulmonary zone. There was a development of multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with mild pleural effusion. The nucleic acid gene detection was positive, and thus the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV was confirmed. At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment. After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered. We presume that 2019-nCoV can also manifest in the nervous system alone, and lung CT, which has relative specificity, should be used as a routine screening method.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronavirus pneumonia (CoV); case report; diagnosis; dizziness; nervous system symptoms.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"sudden dizziness","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"1 month","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient experienced sudden dizziness.

Respiratory droplets and contaction with infected patients are the two major transmission routes. However, the value of tear virus nucleic acid is still not clear. We dynamic detected the SARS-CoV-2 in eye sample of one COVID-19 patient with obstruction of common lacrimal ducts.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              Besides the routine examination, nasopharyngeal and eye swab were continuously measured by polymerase chain reaction assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Gene detection was performed for drug use guidance, and flow cytometry was performed to analyse the lymphocyte subsets.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for 22 days, but eye swabs were still continuously positive for 2 weeks after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative. The low level of lymphocyte and the high level IL-6 lasted for almost 4 weeks, then became near normal. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed the existing of SARS-CoV-2, HSV1 and HHV6B virus nucleic acid. The gene detection for drug use guidance showed the genetic locus ABCB1 (3435T>C) rs1045642 belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir-ritonavir would be significantly decreased.

Usually, after viral pneumonia were clinical cured, the pulmonary lesions of majority patients will gradually be absorbed to complete dissipation, very few severe patients may retain pulmonary interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (1-3). In this case, we described one unique COVID-19 patient, the symptoms were: dry cough, fatigue, poor appetite and subjective fever, moreover, the patient was a non-smoker, had no pulmonary bullous, no history of tuberculosis, and also no hypertension or diabetes. The patient received antiviral therapy, antibacterial therapy, recombinant human interferon-α2a, vitamin C and oxygen inhalation. After two weeks of treatment and observation, the patient was clinical cured and discharged. However, two days later, the patient had a sudden chest stuffiness, CT images indicted: his lung didn't heal like others, but developed a large pulmonary cavity in the lower lobe of right lung. In hospital, the patient showed no symptoms of infection for another 14 days, and the pulmonary cavity remain unchanged. This case suggested: it is important to follow convalescent COVID-19 patients, especially their lung CT images, to make sure a fully recovery.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); case report; pulmonary cavity; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2).","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"14 days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient developed a large cystic cavity in the lower lobe of the right lung with a small amount of fluid inside after completion of treatment in hospital.

The virus is highly infectious. Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3\r\n+\r\n T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients.

The virus is highly infectious. Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3\r\n+\r\n T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients.

No patient had respiratory comorbidity. Seven patients had bilateral lesions and three had unilateral lesions on imaging. All patients had received other medications for COVID-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, before administration of RDV. Five patients required supplemental oxygen and one required mechanical ventilation. All patients showed clinical and laboratory evidence of improvement.
