We reduced immunosuppressive regimen in all these patients, typically holding the antiproliferative agent and augmenting steroids; everybody received hydroxychloroquine, initial empiric antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam, and high-dose low molecular weight heparin. Clinical course seemed favorable in three of our patients, but one of them deteriorated after 10 days of hospitalization, probably due to an acute form of graft dysfunction triggered both by COVID-19 and a nosocomial bacterial infection, and eventually died. Although short-term prognosis could be considered benign in the majority of our patients, we should carefully monitor these individuals in order to detect early sign of clinical deterioration and graft dysfunction in the next few months.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Series","number_of_patients":4,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":true,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Cystic Fibrosis post lung transplant on prednisone, tacrolimus and everolimus.

The most likely diagnosis remains Takotsubo syndrome based on the patients apical ballooning on ventriculogram and patent coronary arteries on angiography.\r\nThis patient was intubated upon admission to the hospital. They were administered colchicine and methylprednisolone 1/mg/kg/day, IV continuous heparin for anticoagulation and extubated after 6 days after which he received methylprednisolone (40 mg, BID). Patient was discharged to outpatient rehabilitation without medical symptoms.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[7023,8233,9077,10776]},{"id":6471,"regimens":[{"id":12641,"duration":{"id":6633,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9780,"name":"Piperacillin-Tazobactam","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9780","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10505,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12641}],"created":"2020-11-16T17:10:54.847960Z","updated":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.218712Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6471},{"id":12702,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":6038,"name":"Aspirin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6038","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10622,"answer":"It was not used in a new way","answer_other":"","regimen":12702}],"created":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.239471Z","updated":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.254870Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6471},{"id":12703,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":7148,"name":"Dalteparin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/7148","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10623,"answer":"It was not used in a new way","answer_other":"","regimen":12703}],"created":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.243590Z","updated":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.255679Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6471},{"id":12704,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":7629,"name":"Enoxaparin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/7629","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10624,"answer":"It was not used in a new way","answer_other":"","regimen":12704}],"created":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.247367Z","updated":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.256476Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6471},{"id":12705,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":8233,"name":"Heparin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8233","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10625,"answer":"It was not used in a new way","answer_other":"","regimen":12705}],"created":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.251092Z","updated":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.257272Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6471}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14543,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6471},{"id":14544,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6471},{"id":14545,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6471}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4609,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6471}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-11-16T17:10:37.597229Z","updated":"2020-11-17T18:31:49.210553Z","title":"Hyperacute multi-organ thromboembolic storm in COVID-19: a case report.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32506364,"doi":"10.1007/s11239-020-02173-w","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32506364/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Chibane S\r\nGibeau G\r\nPoulin F\r\nTessier P\r\nGoulet M\r\nCarrier M\r\nLanthier S","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis","abstract":"Acute viral pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe inflammatory response are hallmarks of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We report a 66-year-old female patient with post-mortem diagnosis of COVID-19 who presented progressive livedo racemosa, acute renal failure and myocardial injury, as well as an absence of respiratory symptoms. Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe spontaneous echo contrast in the right cardiac chambers and right-sided cardiac overload presumed to result from pulmonary microvascular thrombosis or embolism.

Her predominantly thromboembolic presentation supports the concept of coronavirus infection of endothelial cells and hypercoagulability, or COVID-19 endotheliitis.

A man diagnosed with COVID-19 was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. The patient's O2 saturation was 80% using an oxygen mask, which was gradually declining.

Pulmonary Angiography could not be done in these patients due to poor general condition, but 2D echo was normal and none of the patients was in shock. So there was no conventional indication of thrombolysis in these patients, yet after thrombolysis, we saw dramatic changes in oxygenation. All patients became off oxygen within 3-7 days and were discharged within 2 weeks.

At present, an effective treatment regimen and vaccination has not been established. Many patients develop severe symptoms requiring endotracheal intubation and a prolonged stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In early postmortem examinations of COVID-19 patients, profuse viscous secretions were observed throughout the respiratory tract. Thus, oxygen supplementation without aggressive pulmonary hygiene management may be suboptimal. In the present case series, pulmonary hygiene management encompassed mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning. We report 3 severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in cruise ship employees who were admitted to the ICU and responded to supportive mechanical ventilation and pulmonary hygiene management. \r\n\r\nCASE REPORT Three cruise ship employees with COVID-19 underwent endotracheal intubation and were admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Initial chest X-rays suggested multifocal pneumonia with superimposed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A regimen of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and dexamethasone was initiated on admission in all cases. Additionally, medications used for pulmonary hygiene were administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in line with the ventilator circuit. Endotracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration. The duration from endotracheal intubation to extubation ranged from 9 to 24 days. All 3 patients reached 30-day survival. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS The cases reported highlight the importance of the use of airway hygiene with mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilatory support.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"71-80 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Coronary Artery Disease","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, Kidneys, Gastrointestinal System","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, dry cough, fever, dyspnea, septic shock, acute kidney failure, hypotension, acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Prior to breathing treatments, tracheal suctioning was performed to remove secretions.\n\nOn day 24 of hospitalization, the patient was extubated.

At present, an effective treatment regimen and vaccination has not been established. Many patients develop severe symptoms requiring endotracheal intubation and a prolonged stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In early postmortem examinations of COVID-19 patients, profuse viscous secretions were observed throughout the respiratory tract. Thus, oxygen supplementation without aggressive pulmonary hygiene management may be suboptimal. In the present case series, pulmonary hygiene management encompassed mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning. We report 3 severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in cruise ship employees who were admitted to the ICU and responded to supportive mechanical ventilation and pulmonary hygiene management. \r\n\r\nCASE REPORT Three cruise ship employees with COVID-19 underwent endotracheal intubation and were admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Initial chest X-rays suggested multifocal pneumonia with superimposed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A regimen of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and dexamethasone was initiated on admission in all cases. Additionally, medications used for pulmonary hygiene were administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in line with the ventilator circuit. Endotracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration. The duration from endotracheal intubation to extubation ranged from 9 to 24 days.

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.
