The chest CT on that same day showed multiple patchy ground-glass opacities in the upper and lower lobes of both lungs.\r\n\r\nOn day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Oseltamivir  (kewei®75mg, bid, po) and Yinlianjiedutang (Chinese medicine) were added to her antiviral  treatment.
