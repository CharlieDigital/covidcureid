Here,we report on  the isolation  and  characterization  of 206  RBD-specific  monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones.Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However,  the antibody  neutralizing  potency  is  determined  by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific48while that cross-recognition target regions outsidethe RBD.The specificity and 49neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity  requires  further investigation. Nevertheless,  the  diverse and potent  neutralizing  antibodies identified  here are promising  candidates  for  prophylactic  and  therapeutic SARS-CoV-2interventions.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":8,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"hypertension","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"2 weeks","additional_info":"Interferon atomization\r\nEver on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: NR\r\nAuthor defined severe?: severe\r\nDay in disease course that symptoms were noted to begin improving: NR\r\nDay in disease course that full resolution of symptoms was noted: NR\r\nDay in disease course that patient was discharged if admitted: N/A\r\nJustification for timing of resolution: \"All subjects recovered and were discharged from the hospital except for P#1 who succumbed to disease despite intensive intervention\"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[10130]},{"id":5518,"regimens":[{"id":10295,"duration":{"id":4260,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8459,"name":"Interferon","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8459","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6147,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10295},{"id":6148,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10295}],"created":"2020-05-14T14:39:12.800885Z","updated":"2020-05-14T14:49:28.712974Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5518},{"id":10296,"duration":{"id":4261,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6149,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10296},{"id":6150,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10296}],"created":"2020-05-14T14:39:12.809448Z","updated":"2020-05-14T14:49:28.713903Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5518},{"id":10297,"duration":{"id":4262,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":10130,"name":"Ribavirin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10130","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6151,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10297},{"id":6152,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10297}],"created":"2020-05-14T14:39:12.816436Z","updated":"2020-05-14T14:49:28.714831Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5518}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7266,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5518},{"id":7267,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5518},{"id":7268,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5518}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":12064,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5518},{"id":12065,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5518},{"id":12066,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5518}],"author_username":"Parvesh Paul","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.","author_country":"India","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3340,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5518}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-05-14T14:32:03.895132Z","updated":"2020-05-14T14:49:28.660364Z","title":"COVID-19 in a patient with long-term use of glucocorticoids: A study of a familial cluster.

The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak. All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N=1051).          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e. 3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4.5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, P-value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population.

It was decided to initiate ribavirin 1,200 mg p.o. b.i.d. and immunoglobulin 20 mg i.v. daily. Meropenem and teicoplanin were also started to cover any probable bacterial sources. After 2 days, on 10 March 2020, his clinical condition worsened. Dyspnea continued with greater severity and he had an oxygen saturation of 83%.the patient was a candidate for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, this did not happen. Tocilizumab was considered as a last-chance therapy.Hence, tocilizumab (Actemra Hoffmann-La Roche Limited) at a single dose of 400 mg was infused over 2 hours. After 2 days, the patient's dyspnea had gradually improved and his oxygen saturation increased to 90%.Recovery was observed over the next few days, and dyspnea and oxygen saturation significantly improved.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342,8412,8466,8783,9463,10130,10776]},{"id":6197,"regimens":[{"id":11833,"duration":{"id":5831,"approximate_duration":"3

It is largely unknown whether the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic immune diseases has some specific manifestations, or makes them more prone to rapidly progress into severe COVID-19. In this case report, we describe the clinical features of 5 rheumatic immune disease patients with the concomitant presence of COVID-19. Amongst these patients, 4 had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 1 had systemic sclerosis (SSc). Two patients had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient. The age of the patients ranged between 51 and 79 years. Fever (80%), cough (80%), dyspnea (40%), and fatigue (20%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Laboratory investigations revealed leukopenia and lymphopenia in 2 patients. In all the patients, chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed patchy ground glass opacities in the lungs. During the hospital stay, the condition of two patients remained the same (i.e., mild COVID-19), two patients progressed to the severe COVID-19, and one patient worsened to the critically ill COVID-19. These patients were treated with antiviral agents for COVID-19, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, and immunomodulatory agents for rheumatic immune diseases.

The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 where a woman  in her 40s with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14-day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan.

The use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 remains a major controversy. Available evidences are inconclusive. According to WHO guidance, corticosteroids are not recommended to be used unless for another reason. Chinese Thoracic Society (CTS) proposes an expert consensus statement that suggests taking a prudent attitude of corticosteroid usage.

We investigated changes in the fecal fungal microbiomes (mycobiome) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and on recovery.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 30 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through May 12, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronovirus; Intestine; Microbe; Yeast.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":30,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Hong Kong","country_treated":"Hong Kong","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":true,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Hypothyroidism, Chronic hepatitis B carrier","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, fever, cough","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including hypothyroidism, hypertension, and they are a chronic hepatitis B carrier.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"Hepatitis B carrier","disease":630,"drugs":[8783,10130]},{"id":6657,"regimens":[{"id":13312,"duration":{"id":7202,"approximate_duration":"68 Days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":11385,"name":"Lianhua Qingwen","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11385","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11786,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13312},{"id":11787,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13312}],"created":"2020-12-02T20:10:53.632531Z","updated":"2020-12-17T19:07:58.033031Z","dose":"6 grams","frequency":"TID","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6657},{"id":13313,"duration":{"id":7203,"approximate_duration":"68 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":10130,"name":"Ribavirin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10130","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11788,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13313},{"id":11789,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13313}],"created":"2020-12-02T20:10:53.640467Z","updated":"2020-12-17T19:07:58.039420Z","dose":"900-1200 mg","frequency":"TID","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6657},{"id":13314,"duration":{"id":7204,"approximate_duration":"11 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":11423,"name":"Ritonavir-boosted Danoprevir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11423","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11790,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13314}],"created":"2020-12-02T20:10:53.647503Z","updated":"2020-12-17T19:07:58.045310Z","dose":"100/100 mg (one tablet)","frequency":"BID","route":"PO","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"Given alone after treatment with lianhua qingwen granules and ribavirin","comments":null,"report":6657}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8733,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6657},{"id":8734,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6657}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":15020,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6657},{"id":15021,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6657}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4844,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6657}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":530,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-12-02T20:09:33.271978Z","updated":"2020-12-17T19:07:58.025170Z","title":"Long-term positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ribonucleic acid and therapeutic effect of antivirals in patients with coronavirus disease: Case reports.

Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronovirus; Intestine; Microbe; Yeast.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":30,"article_patient_number":"27","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Egypt","country_treated":"Hong Kong","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":true,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Cervical radiculopathy, bilateral varicose vein with bilateral Trendelenburg operation","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, fever","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including cervical radiculopathy and bilateral varicose vein with Trendelenburg operation.

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.
