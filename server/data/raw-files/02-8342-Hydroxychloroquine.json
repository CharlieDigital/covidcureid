Patient in moderate respiratory distress with bilateral crackles. Lab values: WBC 20.7k/L with neutrophilic predominance (92%) and lymphopenia (2.8%). Lab values: PaO2 44 on FiO2 100%. Serum K (5.0mg/dL, normal 3.5–5.1 mg/dL) and Mg (1.9 mg/dL, normal 1.6–2.3 mg/dL). Serum Ca was low (7.7 mg/dL, normal 8.4-10.4 mg/dL) and phosphate high (9.0 mg/dL, normal < 4.5 mg/dL) in keeping with acute renal failure with Cr rising from 2.4 to 6.5mg/dl (normal < 1.1 mg/dL) within 24h of admission.

Imaging: CXR revealed bilateral peripheral focal consolidation and right pleural effusion. Baseline EKG sinus rhythm QT/QTc 298/403 msec figure 1a). Treatment & Outcome: Patient was admitted to ICU telemetry, intubated and started on hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID day one then 200mg BID and azithromycin 500 mg day one then 250mg daily. Day 2 EKG revealed repeated torsades de pointes though QT/QTc remained normal (250/427 msec fig 1b). Six hours later patient experienced cardiac arrest. Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful, despite defibrillation.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: Both HC and AZ are capable of prolonging QT(3,4) and macrolide (AZ) is a well-known CYA-3A4 inhibitor which may decrease HC metabolism raising the potential for cardiotoxic accumulation and arrhythmia. Doses of HC as high as 1200mg are being suggested(1).  In view of the beneficial results with HC alone(2) perhaps the initial loading dose of AZ might be omitted particularly in patients with multiorgan failure. Prophylactic mexiletine might also be considered based on the prior efficacy of quinidine mexiletine combinations(5). Notably, there was no premonitory QT prolongation documented prior to or concurrent with torsades.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"Acute renal failure, Hepatic transaminitis","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342]},{"id":5347,"regimens":[{"id":9905,"duration":{"id":3991,"approximate_duration":"","dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5614,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9905}],"created":"2020-04-14T13:41:21.006424Z","updated":"2020-09-30T21:05:42.486810Z","dose":"400 mg","frequency":"BID","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5347}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[],"author_username":"Roman Pachulski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[{"id":364,"author_username":"Fernando Lundgren","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":null,"author_country":"","created":"2020-04-15T08:23:52.913396Z","updated":"2020-04-15T08:23:52.913430Z","body":"How long was hydorxicloroquine used?","datetime":"2020-04-15T08:23:52.913479Z","anonymous":false,"deleted":false,"flagged":false,"report":5347},{"id":365,"author_username":"Roman Pachulski","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":null,"author_country":"","created":"2020-04-15T10:09:29.498567Z","updated":"2020-04-15T10:09:29.498601Z","body":"24 h HC","datetime":"2020-04-15T10:09:29.498649Z","anonymous":false,"deleted":false,"flagged":false,"report":5347},{"id":367,"author_username":"Parvesh Paul","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.","author_country":"India","created":"2020-04-15T21:12:10.257300Z","updated":"2020-04-15T21:12:10.257333Z","body":"Thanks for sharing your experience.

Viral testing negative for influenza, RSV, HIV, and COVID.\r\nBilateral ground glass consolidation on CT (97% sensitivity for COVID detection(1)) together with lymphopenic leukocytosis, elevated ferritin, AST, LD, hypoxia and prior admitted sick exposure during COVID-19 pandemic make COVID-19 the most likely the cause of pneumonia, MH and pericarditis despite PCR negativity (65% nasopharyngeal sensitivity(2)). Persistent deterioration following pericardial drainage would only be expected with aortic dissection(3), tension pneumothorax or operative vascular misadventure (all excluded). Massive PE is unlikely with, normal coagulation parameters, young age, male gender, negative CT and brief immobility. HC induced G6PD deficiency hemolysis unlikely without significant Hb decline(4). \r\n\r\nThe low-grade intraoperative fever was consistent with COVID pneumonia/pericarditis. Rising lactate was ascribed to COVID-induced vasoplegia. CK rise credibly resulted from cardiomyocyte release of pericarditis however, fractionation later suggested a largely (99%) skeletal origin. Intraoperative hypercarbia was noted but, proved ventilation responsive. Hyperkalemic QRS widening coincided with only modest serum K 5.2 mmol/L. MH is nevertheless supported by intense skeletal myolysis at admission, persistent hypotension after surgical tamponade relief and worsening metabolic hyperactivity (rising lactate, hyperkalemic EKG changes, worsening tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, refractory hypotension) with sevoflurane and marked hyperthermia after succinylcholine.","drug_treatment_features":"sevoflurane - 90 min Continuous inhalation anesthetic \r\nsuccinylcholine.- 70mg IV single dose","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"Exacerbation of COVID Fever-Induced Malignant Hyperthermia. \r\n\r\nMH is supported by intense skeletal myolysis at admission, persistent hypotension after surgical tamponade relief and worsening metabolic hyperactivity (rising lactate, hyperkalemic EKG changes, worsening tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, refractory hypotension) with sevoflurane and marked hyperthermia after succinylcholine.","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"2 weeks","additional_info":"MH is an intense hypermetabolic state with skeletal muscle rigidity, ventilation refractory hypercarbia, acidemia (hypotension), hyperkalemia and hyperthermia triggered by intense exercise, fever, halogenated anesthetics or succinylcholine. Prior uneventful anesthesia does not exclude MH. MH is the result of an autosomal dominant ryanodine receptor mutation resulting in excess intracellular calcium release. Hyperthermia is a late finding in MH. Upon MH recognition the offending halogenated agent should be replaced with high fresh gas flow and urgent dantrolene administration (ryanodine receptor blocking reversing agent). Bicarbonate and other hyperkalemia interventions may be required. Subsequent genetic counselling and testing is warranted for family members(5 ).\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nFebrile illness with massive skeletal myolysis in the absence of toxic habits should prompt consideration of MH particularly after endotracheal intubation or successful surgical intervention.\r\n\r\n(1) Correlation of Chest CT and RT-PCR Testing in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: A Report of 1014 Cases Tao Ai*, Zhenlu Yang*, Hongyan Hou, Chenao Zhan, Chong Chen, Wenzhi Lv, Qian Tao, Ziyong Sun, Liming Xia Published Online:Feb 26 2020https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020200642\r\n(2) Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Different Types of Clinical Specimens Wenling Wang, PhD1; Yanli Xu, MD2; Ruqin Gao, MD3; Roujian Lu, MPH1; Kai Han, BS2; Guizhen Wu, MD1; Wenjie Tan, MD, PhD1 JAMA.

Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported as part of the\r\ninitial clinical presentation, but they are rather rare (around 3%-5% depending on the series).2,6,7 Two days later he also had productive cough without dyspnea, and his fever persisted. On the fourth day, he\r\npresented conjunctivitis of his left eye. A chest x-ray showed an opacity compatible with right lower lobe pneumonia, and his CRP rose to 13 mg/dL. This is compatible with serious reported cases, where\r\npneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection. It is characterized primarily by fever and cough, but it is usually accompanied by dyspnea, and bilateral instead of unilateral infiltrates on chest imaging.7 This could be related to the fact that he had a normal total lymphocyte count, and that the severity of the disease has been associated with lymphopenia.8 His conjunctivitis is also an infrequent symptom, that could be explained by evidence that the virus may be present in conjunctival secretions, with around 0.8%of cases presenting with conjunctival congestion.9-13\r\n\r\nOur protocol at patient admission recommended screening for SARS-Cov2 in (1) patients presenting respiratory symptoms and epidemiologic risk of contact with infected or contagious individuals and (2) patients presenting with pneumonia of unknown origin. Nevertheless, in immunocompromised populations, such as SOT recipients, COVID-19 infection should be considered in the presence\r\nof an atypical presentation and screening protocols may be needed to be re-evaluated. Hence, and since the increase in the number of cases and evidence of asymptomatic transmission among the community, contact with infected individuals was no longer mandatory.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"2 weeks","additional_info":"Thereafter, although the patient didn't have any travel history nor reported known contacts with contagious or infected people, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected for testing COVID-19, following an update of local authorities’ screening protocol of pneumonia of undetermined aetiology. Both swabs for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase–\r\npolymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay were reported positive (hereafter assumed as reference day – D0). \r\n\r\nLocal protocol for COVID-19 was activated, with patient hospitalization under isolation, and treatment with oral Lopinavir/Ritonavir 400/100 BID was initiated at D+1 (Figure 2). Due to the interaction of Ritonavir with calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus was withdrawn, as was everolimus due to its reported risk for mTOR-inhibitor induced neumonitis.4 Empirical broad spectrum antibiotic was also initiated (ceftaroline and meropenem) and maintained, despite negative microbiological cultures for viral, bacterial, or fungal infections, including aspergillosis, pneumocystis, and mycobacteria's. Oral hydroxychloroquine treatment was prescribed (400 mg BID for 24 hours, afterwards 200 mg BID; oral).\r\n\r\nAfter 10 days since the initial symptoms and 72 hours after supportive and anti-viral treatment, the patient presented a worsening in respiratory symptoms, with hypoxia in spite of the use of highflux nasal oxygen delivery, and a progression to diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray (Figure 1B). Interferon Beta was initiated at this moment. The patient was intubated (D+6), with ventilatory\r\nsupportive care using high positive end-respiratory pressure (PEEP; 12 cm H2O). Serum creatinine increased to 2.1 mg/dL (GFR of 30 mL/min), with tacrolimus through level 10 days after suspension remaining at 5.1 ng/mL.

In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord.\r\n\r\nPatients and methods: This is a case series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and severe pneumonia or ARDS who were treated with up to 4 infusions of eculizumab as an off-label agent. Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day + Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV).\r\n\r\nResults: We treated four COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe pneumonia or ARDS.

In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord.\r\n\r\nPatients and methods: This is a case series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and severe pneumonia or ARDS who were treated with up to 4 infusions of eculizumab as an off-label agent. Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day + Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV).\r\n\r\nResults: We treated four COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe pneumonia or ARDS. All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab. Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers. Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19.

The second patient is a 43-year-old man who had a 1-month history of cough with hemoptoic sputum, evolving to mild respiratory distress in the last 7 days. Both patients already had pulmonary tuberculosis and subsequently developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 2020 pandemic. Nonadherence to antiretroviral treatment may have been a factor in the clinical worsening of the patients.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Brazil","country_treated":"Brazil","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":true,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Pulmonary tuberculosis, Drug abuse, Generalised anxiety disorder","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"COVID-19 infection with TB lung.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient had presented with a history of cough with hemoptoic sputum for more than 1 month, evolving to mild respiratory distress in the last 7 days.

The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCov), now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a wide spectrum of illness and patients with underlying comorbidities have a high mortality. Here we present a 49-year-old male patient with comorbid conditions who presented with fever, cough, myalgia and shortness of breath for five days with likely exposure to a COVID-19 contact. A computed tomography scan of the thorax revealed multifocal bilateral ground-glass lung opacities with areas of subpleural sparing. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was started, and the patient responded favorably with improvement of symptoms.

Two successive doses of intravenous tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor antagonist) at 8 mg/kg (maximum dose of 800 mg) were administered.

Case presentation: A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy.       \r\nDiscussion:      \r\nBlood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients. Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19. All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test.

Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections that respiratory complications are the most obvious symptoms. In this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time. We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides. Further investigations should be conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Case report; Guillain Barre syndrome; Neuropathy; Novel coronavirus.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":false,"outcome":"Patient deteriorated","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory Tract Infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Development of GBS after COVID-19 diagnosis","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"2 weeks","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient treated for COVID19 and then developed neurological symptoms related to GBS two weeks later.

Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID-19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36-year-old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID-19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug-to-drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO-incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course. In addition, antiviral agents should be used cautiously, especially in patients on calcineurin inhibitors.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  clinical research/practice; immunosuppressant; infection and infectious agents - viral; infectious disease; kidney (allograft) function/dysfunction; kidney transplantation/nephrology.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Korea, Republic of","country_treated":"Korea, Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"ESRD with living unrelated donor transplant in April 2016","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Atelectasis","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"On hospital day 2, the fever spiked to 38.5°C, and we decided to discontinue the MMF and to start lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg, bid).

Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm. Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions. We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19.          \r\n        Materials and methods:      \r\n              Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              Preliminary observations and a strong scientific foundation suggest that nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; cytokine storm; neuromodulation; non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation; respiratory symptoms.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"seasonal allergies, sleep apnea, and hypercholesterolemia and ongoing use of a continuous positive airway pressure device for sleep apnea for 15 years","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Ongoing medications at hospital admission included ramipril (10 mg/d, for hypertension), metformin (2000 mg/d, for diabetes), glipizide (10 mg/d, for diabetes), and atorvastatin (40 mg/d for hypercholesterolemia). \r\n\r\nHe was provided supplemental oxygen (2 L via nasal cannula) but reported that he repeatedly stopped using it, owing to nasal dryness and epistaxis.

She was started on intravenous azithromycin on March 18. The decision was made to start hydroxychloroquine on March 21; however, it was stopped after 1 dose owing to a QTc of 620 ms with a notched broad T wave. No ventricular ectopy was present. Serum potassium and magnesium were 4.4 mM and 2.9 mg/dL, respectively. Electrophysiology consultation recommended 100 mg intravenous lidocaine followed by a repeat 12-lead electrocardiogram. This revealed a shortening of the QTc to 550 ms. It was recommended to restart hydroxychloroquine and begin a lidocaine infusion. The patient was able to complete the course of hydroxychloroquine without an arrhythmic event. Despite receiving a full course of hydroxychloroquine, she remained ventilator dependent and died owing to progressive metabolic acidosis and multiorgan system failure on March 25. By the time hydroxychloroquine was first initiated, she had already been intubated for 72 hours and was in severe respiratory

They had a positive PCR confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection on hospital day 2 and were started on Hydroxychloroquine. HCQ was continued through hospital day 5 and then was stopped. Due to worsening oxygen requirements and increased inflammatory markers and infiltrates on CXR, Tocilizumab was administered on hospital day 7. Improvement was seen for 2 days, followed by worsening oxygen requirements and inflammatory markers, and a second dose of Tocilizumab was administered on hospital day 11. Patient improved and was discharged from hospital on day 17. \r\n\r\nThe patient is a 65-year-old Hispanic female with history of end stage renal disease secondary to long\r\nstanding diabetes and hypertension who received a deceased donor renal transplant four years prior. She had uneventful post-transplant course with a baseline serum creatinine (SCr) of 1.2 mg/dL and maintained on triple immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone. She presented to the hospital with a 1-week history of worsening cough and shortness of breath. Upon presentation, patient was hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Her examination was significant for crackles in both lung fields. \r\n\r\nLaboratory findings revealed WBC 4.9 k/mm3 with lymphopenia (0.6 k/mm3), procalcitonin 0.17 ng/mL,\r\ntroponin-I <0.040 ng/mL, BNP 68 pg/mL, SCr 1.3 mg/dL, AST 39 units/L and tacrolimus trough level 7.0 ng/mL. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral reticulonodular pulmonary opacities. Supplemental oxygen of 2 L/min by nasal cannula and an empiric antibiotic regimen of ceftriaxone and azithromycin were initiated. A nasal swab multiplex viral PCR panel and blood cultures were negative. \r\n\r\nOn hospital day 2, upon the COVID-19 nasal swab PCR resulting positive, hydroxychloroquine was initiated. Mycophenolate was discontinued and dosing of tacrolimus was lowered to target trough levels of 3-5 ng/mL. Despite remaining afebrile and normotensive throughout hospitalization, she had progressively increasing oxygen requirements. Inflammatory markers collected on hospital day 5 including CRP and ferritin were noted to be significantly elevated at 16.4 mg/dL and 2671 ng/mL respectively. Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg daily was then initiated but no improvement was noted. She also developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with SCr of 1.7 mg/dL and mild transaminitis (AST 73 units/L, ALT 47 units/L). With increasing oxygen requirement to 15 L/min, worsening of inflammatory markers and CXR infiltrates, tocilizumab 400 mg (5 mg/kg) was administered on hospital day 7.\r\n\r\nAn IL-6 level obtained prior to tocilizumab administration was 241 pg/mL. Subsequently by hospital day 9,\r\noxygen requirements improved to 6 L/min along with improvements in inflammatory markers and CXR\r\ninfiltrates. On hospital day 11, patient again had increasing oxygen requirements to 11 L/min with up trending LDH and worsening CXR infiltrates. Given this, a second dose of tocilizumab 400 mg was administered. \r\n\r\nFollowing this dose, patient had progressive improvement in hypoxia, inflammatory markers, as well as\r\ninfiltrates on CXR. Patient was discharged on day 17 of hospitalization on 4 L/min of supplemental oxygen with resolved AKI and transaminitis. Figure 1 summarizes treatment therapies, oxygen requirement, and inflammatory markers during hospital course.\r\n\r\nOur case illustrated the utility of tocilizumab in treating SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory syndrome\r\nin a transplant recipient. Further randomized studies are necessary to confirm the benefit, optimal dosing,\r\nand timing of administration of IL-6Ra therapies in the management of COVID-19 in transplant recipients.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342,10776]},{"id":6005,"regimens":[{"id":11295,"duration":{"id":5350,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6675,"name":"Ceftriaxone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6675","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7773,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11295},{"id":7772,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11295}],"created":"2020-09-21T12:58:35.801274Z","updated":"2020-09-21T13:10:27.808377Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6005},{"id":11296,"duration":{"id":5351,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7774,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11296},{"id":7775,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11296}],"created":"2020-09-21T12:58:35.808640Z","updated":"2020-09-21T13:10:27.814506Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6005},{"id":11297,"duration":{"id":5352,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7776,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11297},{"id":7777,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11297}],"created":"2020-09-21T12:58:35.814781Z","updated":"2020-09-21T13:10:27.820108Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6005},{"id":11298,"duration":{"id":5353,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":10776,"name":"Tocilizumab","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10776","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7778,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11298},{"id":7779,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11298}],"created":"2020-09-21T12:58:35.820966Z","updated":"2020-09-21T13:10:27.825752Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6005}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7868,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6005}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13402,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6005},{"id":13403,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6005},{"id":13404,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6005}],"author_username":"Parvesh Paul","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.","author_country":"India","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3964,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6005}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":275,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-21T12:57:37.298328Z","updated":"2020-09-21T13:10:27.800187Z","title":"Rescue therapy for severe COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome with tissue plasminogen activator: A case series.

The first reported case happened in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. At present, at least 1.8 million people are infected around the world and almost 110,000 people have died. Many studies have analyzed the clinical picture of COVID-19, but they are focused on respiratory symptoms and headache is generically treated.          \r\n        \r\nMethods:      \r\nI describe and discuss my headaches during my COVID-19 and I review the MEDLINE literature about headaches and COVID-19.          \r\n        \r\nResults:      \r\nMore than 41,000 COVID-19 patients have been included in clinical studies and headache was present in 8%-12% of them. However, no headache characterization was made in these studies. As a headache expert and based on my own personal clinical case, headaches related to COVID-19 can be classified in the 2 phases of the disease. Acute headache attributed to systemic viral infection, primary cough headache, tension-type headache and headache attributed to heterophoria can appear in the first phase (the influenza-like phase); and headache attributed to hypoxia and a new headache, difficult to fit into the ICHD3, can appear if the second phase (the cytokine storm phase) occurs.          \r\n        \r\nConclusions:      \r\nSeveral headaches can appear during COVID-19 infection. All of them are headaches specified in the ICHD3, except 1 that occurs from the 7th day after the clinical onset. This headache is probably related to the cytokine storm that some patients suffer and it could be framed under the ICHD3 headache of Headache attributed to other non-infectious inflammatory intracranial disease. Although the reported prevalence of headaches as a symptom of COVID-19 infection is low, this experience shows that, very probably, it is underestimated.          \r\n        \r\nKeywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-12; coronavirus; cytokine storm; headache.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, systemic","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, Headaches, Hypoxia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"Acetaminophen","unusual":"Patient was a physician (neurologist specializing in headaches) and detailed the types of headaches he experienced at different stages of the infection.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"14 days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"I was admitted to the hospital and started treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus oxygen therapy by means of a nasal catheter at 3 L/min.

However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Infection control; Migrants; Mortality; Sequelae; TB.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":8,"article_patient_number":"6","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":true,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Alcohol, COPD, liver steatosis","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"HRZE, C+/SS+\r\nHb saturation: 93%, room air\r\nCT/C-X ray: bilateral infiltrates\r\nBCG status unknown, COVID-19 major determinant of death; COVID-19 acquired at hospital","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"Pulmonary tuberculosis","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342]},{"id":6015,"regimens":[{"id":11317,"duration":{"id":5372,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7806,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11317},{"id":8396,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11317}],"created":"2020-09-21T16:11:25.605549Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:24:44.981312Z","dose":"400mg","frequency":"QD","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6015},{"id":11318,"duration":{"id":5373,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7807,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11318},{"id":8397,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11318}],"created":"2020-09-21T16:11:25.614165Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:24:44.982140Z","dose":"500mg","frequency":"QD","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6015}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7879,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6015},{"id":7880,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6015}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13432,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6015}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3980,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6015}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[],"races":[{"id":286,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-21T16:03:24.866913Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:24:44.943349Z","title":"Two distinct cases with COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients.

Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID-19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36-year-old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID-19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug-to-drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO-incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course.

(COVID-19) was initially characterized by fever, sore throat, cough, and dyspnea, mainly manifestations of respiratory system. However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11%-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients were new-onset, moderate-severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6%-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV-2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n

The aim of this study is to describe a group of patients who died with TB (active disease or sequelae) and COVID-19 in two cohorts. Data from 49 consecutive cases in 8 countries (cohort A) and 20 hospitalised patients with TB and COVID-19 (cohort B) were analysed and patients who died were described. Demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB and COVID-19 mortality. Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B. Migrants: (1) were younger than natives; in cohort A the median (IQR) age was 40 (27-49) VS. 66 (46-70) years, whereas in cohort B 37 (27-46) VS. 48 (47-60) years; (2) had a lower mortality rate than natives (1/43, 2.3% versus 7/26, 26.9%; p-value: 0.002); (3) had fewer co-morbidities than natives (23/43, 53.5% versus 5/26-19.2%) natives; p-value: 0.005).

However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Infection control; Migrants; Mortality; Sequelae; TB.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":8,"article_patient_number":"8","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":true,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, renal failure","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"CT/C-X ray: bilateral infiltrates\r\nHRZE, C pending/SS+\r\nHb saturation: 99% with re-breather mask, 15 l/min, non-invasive ventilation performed\r\nBCG: unknown\r\nCOVID-19 accelerated death, although the patients was already very compromised since admission\r\nCOVID-19 acquired at hospital","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"Pulmonary tuberculosis","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342,8783,9780]},{"id":6024,"regimens":[{"id":11335,"duration":{"id":5390,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7841,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11335},{"id":7840,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11335}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:50:07.272050Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:58:18.830878Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6024},{"id":11336,"duration":{"id":5391,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7842,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11336},{"id":7843,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11336}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:50:07.279569Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:58:18.837467Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6024}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13454,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6024},{"id":13455,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6024},{"id":13456,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6024}],"author_username":"Reema Charles","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3991,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6024},{"id":3992,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":6024}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":292,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:48:51.859442Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:58:18.823269Z","title":"Co-infection with COVID-19 and influenza A virus in two died patients with acute respiratory syndrome, Bojnurd, Iran.

Case reports and case series depicting the clinical effects of the causative virus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-have been published, yet few demonstrate the cytopathologic alterations of this disease. We present a clinical-pathologic correlation report of a previously healthy Hispanic woman with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had typical features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and also showed cardiac abnormalities thought to represent fulminant viral myocarditis. Congruent with the ARDS clinical impression, autopsy findings were remarkable for extensive and markedly severe acute lung injury consistent with viral pneumonia, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary infarction, severe pulmonary edema, desquamation of pneumocytes with intra-alveolar aggregation, and pneumocyte morphologic alterations suggestive of viral cytopathic effect. However, there was incongruence between the clinical impression and the cardiovascular pathology findings in that viral myocarditis was not detected on histopathologic evaluation. This case highlights the importance of pathologic corroboration of the clinical impression and, in addition, illuminates the key role autopsy plays during a pandemic by providing valuable insight into viral pathology in tissues.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Developed severe multiorgan failure and died.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342,10776]},{"id":6037,"regimens":[{"id":11361,"duration":{"id":5416,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7873,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11361},{"id":8412,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11361}],"created":"2020-09-22T15:41:54.548091Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:49:25.406106Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6037},{"id":11362,"duration":{"id":5417,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7874,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11362},{"id":8413,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11362}],"created":"2020-09-22T15:41:54.555606Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:49:25.406984Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6037},{"id":11363,"duration":{"id":5418,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":10776,"name":"Tocilizumab","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10776","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7875,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11363},{"id":8414,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11363}],"created":"2020-09-22T15:41:54.562623Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:49:25.407803Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6037}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7906,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6037},{"id":7907,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6037}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13487,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6037},{"id":13488,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6037}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4010,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6037}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-09-22T15:41:23.931430Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:49:25.359254Z","title":"Abnormalities on chest computed tomography in patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for the pandemic reasoned respiratory insufficiency and death. At first, it was thought that the patients who use immunmodulator therapy could be even at higher risks of disease complications. However, it has been also speculated about that using immunmodulators could be an advantage for the clinical prognosis. Therefore, several immunmodulators are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with type 1 interferon for multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Despite using immunmodulator, the symptoms of the patient at hospitalization were mild and he did not show elevated D-dimer, and there was no lymphopenia.

As of today, 3 April 2020, 972,640 people affected and 50,325 people died from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2. There is not any standard treatment for coronavirus infection 2019; however, there are promising data for hydroxychloroquine and some anti-retroviral drugs. Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) pathway is an important target for the cancer immunotherapy. However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections. Thus, blockade of this pathway may lead to an anti-viral effect and decrease viral load. Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma. In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding. We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.

The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak. All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N=1051).          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e. 3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4.5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, P-value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population.

We present a case of life-threatening CRS caused by COVID-19 infection successfully treated with TCZ.          \r\n        Learning points:      \r\n              Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by COVID-19.CRS can be life-threatening in severe COVID-19.Tocilizumab may have a role in treating severe COVID-19 patients with CRS.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Tocilizumab; cytokine release syndrome.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Turkey","country_treated":"Turkey","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Mechanical ventilation + \r\nlow-molecular-weight heparin\r\nA chest x-ray showed that the lesions significantly improved within 3 days of TCZ administration\r\nThe patient was successfully extubated 5 days after treatment with TCZ.

Presently, emergency surgery for patients with suspected COVID-19 is burdensome not only for patients but also for healthcare workers. Therefore, we established a surveillance system in the emergency room and established principles for managing patients suspected of COVID-19 who require emergency surgery.          \r\n        Case summary:      \r\n              A 67-year-old man was diagnosed with appendicitis in March 2020. His wife was diagnosed with COVID-19 10 d earlier, and the patient was in close contact with her. The patient tested negative twice on an upper respiratory COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screening test, but chest X-ray and chest computed tomography revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in both upper lobes of the patient's lungs. The same emergency surgery procedure for patients with confirmed COVID-19 was applied to this patient suspected of having the disease to ensure that surgery was not delayed while waiting for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results. A few hours after surgery, the upper respiratory tract specimen taken in the emergency room was negative for COVID-19 but the lower respiratory tract specimen was found to be positive for the disease.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              When COVID-19 is suspected, emergency surgery should be performed as for confirmed COVID-19 without delay.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Appendectomy; Appendicitis; COVID-19; Case report; Emergency room; Infection control.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Korea, Republic of","country_treated":"Korea, Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Abdominal","clinical_syndrome":"RLQ pain","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"Ceftriaxone\r\nMetronidazole","unusual":"No respiratory symptoms, RLQ pain linked to appendicitis, Upper respiratory tract swab PCR negative.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"11days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[7166,8342,8783]},{"id":6105,"regimens":[{"id":11517,"duration":{"id":5572,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8132,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11517},{"id":8445,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11517}],"created":"2020-09-25T10:14:17.312161Z","updated":"2020-09-28T03:40:34.803337Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6105},{"id":11518,"duration":{"id":5573,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8133,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11518},{"id":8446,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11518}],"created":"2020-09-25T10:14:17.320002Z","updated":"2020-09-28T03:40:34.804175Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6105}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8009,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6105}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13632,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6105}],"author_username":"Belinda Nhundu","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4099,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6105}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":348,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-25T10:13:02.870978Z","updated":"2020-09-28T03:40:34.766935Z","title":"Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19: Report of three cases and a review of literature.Case 1","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32381430,"doi":"10.1016/j.jdermsci.2020.04.011","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32381430/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Sachdeva M\r\nGianotti R\r\nShah M\r\nBradanini L\r\nTosi D\r\nVeraldi S\r\nZiv M\r\nLeshem E\r\nDodiuk-Gad RP","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"Journal of dermatological science","abstract":"Background:      \r\n              Various cutaneous manifestations have been observed in patients with COVID-19 infection.

On HD #3, his D-dimer was > 10,000 ng/mL (from 501 ng/mL on admission). A heparin infusion was started empirically and titrated to an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.5 IU/mL. With the exception of four anti-Xa levels that were slightly supratherapeutic (0.55–0.73 IU/mL), the level remained within the target range. On HD #5, he was enrolled in a clinical trial and was given sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody, or placebo. His subsequent hospital course was complicated by hypotension with increasing vasopressor requirements and acute kidney injury necessitating initiation of dialysis on HD #10. On HD #13, neurocritical care was consulted due to persistent encephalopathy and concern for absent brainstem reflexes.Non-contrast head CT (NCHCT) demonstrated multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, mass effect, and evidence of global anoxic injury, cerebral edema, and downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils.

Her postoperative period was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged on postop day four.\r\n\r\nHer physical examination was unremarkable with all vital signs being normal, including a body temperature of 36.4°C. In her initial blood test results, the patient’s creatinine level was slightly elevated to 1.54 mg/dl from a baseline value of 1.2 mg/dl, the white blood cell count was 9,990/µl, the total lymphocyte count was 600/µ, and her CRP level was elevated at 49.5 ng/L. Stool microscopy was negative for blood and WBCs. Metronidazole was started empirically, and the patient was sent home with instructions for adequate hydration. \r\n\r\nThree days later, the patient was readmitted with a history of worsening diarrhea and a reported body temperature of 38°C at home. During this encounter, her vital signs revealed a body temperature of 37.4°C, a pulse rate of 87/min, a respiratory rate of 22/min, blood pressure of 134/87 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. A thorough physical examination of the chest and abdomen was performed, and no pathologic findings were noted. According to the blood test results at this admission, the patient’s creatinine level was elevated to 2.26 mg/dl, the WBC count was 6,160/µl, the total lymphocyte count was 700/µ and her CRP level was elevated at 76.1 ng/L. Her Tac level was 40 ng/ml. Given the atypical course of COVID-19 in transplant patients, we collected nasopharyngeal swab tests (SARS-CoV-2 PCR, RealStar®, Altona Diagnostics, and German) for COVID-19 and ordered a chest CT scan. The chest CT scan revealed bilateral, multifocal ground glass opacities suggesting coronavirus infection. The patient was hospitalized for close monitoring and further testing. Tac and MMF were discontinued. She was kept on only Pred 10 mg daily.\r\n\r\nHydroxychloroquine was started for COVID-19, and ceftriaxone treatment was added for the prevention of secondary bacterial infections. The COVID test came back positive the following day after hospitalization.\r\n \r\nDuring this admission, the patient’s vital signs remained stable without any decline in oxygen saturation on room air. Her diarrhea and fever improved gradually in two days. She was discharged home with isolation instructions after three days of hospital stay. Currently, the patient has been in good condition without any complaints at home for 20 days.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342]},{"id":6135,"regimens":[{"id":11616,"duration":{"id":5661,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8477,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11616},{"id":8852,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11616}],"created":"2020-09-28T18:01:35.842864Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:13:31.435719Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6135},{"id":11617,"duration":{"id":5662,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8412,"name":"Immunoglobulins, Intravenous","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8412","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8478,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11617},{"id":8853,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11617}],"created":"2020-09-28T18:01:55.043640Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:13:31.436574Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6135}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8047,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6135}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13700,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6135},{"id":13701,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6135}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4133,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6135},{"id":4134,"answer":"Unusual disease presentation","answer_other":"","report":6135}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[],"races":[],"created":"2020-09-28T16:48:33.687405Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:13:31.398689Z","title":"COVID-19-Associated Miller Fisher Syndrome: MRI Findings.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32467190,"doi":"10.3174/ajnr.A6609","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32467190/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Lantos JE\r\nStrauss SB\r\nLin E","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"AJNR.

On 08 March 2020 the clinical condition of the patient deteriorated, and he exhibited dyspnea with an oxygen saturation of 85%. Fever and cough were persistent, and new chest X-ray imaging revealed progression of bilateral infiltration in the lower and upper lobes. It was decided to initiate ribavirin 1,200 mg p.o. b.i.d. and immunoglobulin 20 mg i.v. daily. Meropenem and teicoplanin were also started to cover any probable bacterial sources. After 2 days, on 10 March 2020, his clinical condition worsened. Dyspnea continued with greater severity and he had an oxygen saturation of 83%.the patient was a candidate for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, this did not happen. Tocilizumab was considered as a last-chance therapy.Hence, tocilizumab (Actemra Hoffmann-La Roche Limited) at a single dose of 400 mg was infused over 2 hours. After 2 days, the patient's dyspnea had gradually improved and his oxygen saturation increased to 90%.Recovery was observed over the next few days, and dyspnea and oxygen saturation significantly improved.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342,8412,8466,8783,9463,10130,10776]},{"id":6160,"regimens":[{"id":11716,"duration":{"id":5730,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8645,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11716},{"id":8646,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11716}],"created":"2020-09-30T16:52:18.856009Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:45:47.184228Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6160},{"id":11717,"duration":{"id":5731,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8647,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11717},{"id":8648,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11717}],"created":"2020-09-30T16:52:18.864013Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:45:47.190684Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6160}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8075,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6160},{"id":8076,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6160},{"id":8077,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6160}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13766,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6160},{"id":13767,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6160}],"author_username":"Eleanor McCartney","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4166,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6160}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":379,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-30T16:51:34.374966Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:45:47.176379Z","title":"A case series of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance and COVID-19.

Use of hydroxychloroquine has been popularised on mass media and put forward as a valid treatment option without strong evidence of efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has its own side effects, some of which are very serious like acute haemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient patients. Side effects may be worse than the disease itself. Belgian national treatment guidelines recommend the use of HCQ in mild to severe COVID-19 disease.

\r\n              Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) is a global health crisis, but there is limited guidance for the critical care management of pregnant patients experiencing respiratory collapse. We describe our management of a peri-viable pregnant patient requiring intubation; discussion includes pharmacologic interventions, mechanical ventilation adjustments, and consideration of fetal interventions, including delivery timing.          \r\n        Case:      \r\n              A 30 some-old woman positive for COVID-19 at 23 weeks of gestation with severe disease required admission to the intensive care unit and intubation. She completed 5 days of hydroxychloroquine and 7 days of prednisone. She was successfully intubated after 8 days and discharged home in a stable condition without preterm delivery on hospital day 11.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              Fortunately, the patient responded to aggressive respiratory support with intubation and mechanical ventilation early upon presentation.

The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming the world's medical care capacity with unprecedented needs for mechanical ventilators and high rates of mortality once patients progress to needing mechanical ventilation, and in many environments including in parts of the United States the medical capacity is being exhausted. Fibrinolytic therapy has previously been used in a Phase 1 clinical trial that led to reduced mortality and marked improvements in oxygenation.

Even though end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and can develop severe to critical disease, there are limited studies and case reports about COVID-19 in ESRD patients.

Instead, these patients are often referred for 14-days of home isolation as symptoms resolve. Lung ultrasound is well-established as an important means of evaluating lung pathology in patients in the emergency department and in intensive care units. Ultrasound is also being used to assess admitted patients with COVID-19. However, data on the progression of sonographic findings in patients with COVID-19 on home isolation is lacking. Here we present a case series of a group of physician patients with COVID-19 who monitored themselves daily while in home isolation using lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Lung POCUS findings corresponded with symptom onset and resolution in all 3 patients with confirmed COVID-19 during the 14-day isolation period.

Four out of six patients died, at an average time of 9.75 ± 2.4 days after tocilizumab administration, 3/6 due to a coexistent septic shock. Two patients improved after TCZ and were discharged at 20 and 21 days, respectively; in both patient, a significant increase of total lymphocyte count was observed. In conclusion, KTs, where the role of peculiar factors such as chronic immunosuppression is still undetermined, represent a high-risk group with significant COVID-19-associated mortality.

All four patients experienced significant improvement in objective and symptomatic disease measures after one day of high dose therapy suggesting that zinc therapy was playing a role in clinical recovery. A mechanism for zinc's effects is proposed based on previously published studies on SARS- CoV-1, and randomized controlled trials assessing zinc shortening of common cold duration. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the effectiveness of zinc as a treatment for COVID-19 but suggest the variables to be addressed to confirm these initial

It is unclear whether solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe complications and how they should be managed, also concerning immunosuppression. This is a report about the course and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients from a single center in Northwestern Italy in the period March-April 2020. Three patients who were treated at our institution are reported in detail, whereas summary data are provided for those managed at peripheral Hospitals. Presentation varied from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, treatment and changes to immunosuppression were adapted to the severity of the disease. Overall mortality was 20%, whereas Covid-related mortality was 10%. Two cases of prolonged (>2 months) viral carriage were observed in two asymptomatic patients who contracted the infection in the early course after transplant. Besides depicting Covid-19 course and possible treatment scenarios in liver transplant patients, these cases are discussed in relation to the changes in our practice prompted by Covid-19 epidemic, with potential implications for other transplant programs.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; early infection; immunosuppression; viral carriage.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":10,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":true,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"","clinical_syndrome":"Asymptomatic","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"42 days after proof of infection","relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient received a liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma arising on Hepatitis B infection and alcohol-related cirrhosis with a model for end-stage liver disease score of 18.

It is unclear whether solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe complications and how they should be managed, also concerning immunosuppression. This is a report about the course and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients from a single center in Northwestern Italy in the period March-April 2020. Three patients who were treated at our institution are reported in detail, whereas summary data are provided for those managed at peripheral Hospitals. Presentation varied from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, treatment and changes to immunosuppression were adapted to the severity of the disease. Overall mortality was 20%, whereas Covid-related mortality was 10%. Two cases of prolonged (>2 months) viral carriage were observed in two asymptomatic patients who contracted the infection in the early course after transplant. Besides depicting Covid-19 course and possible treatment scenarios in liver transplant patients, these cases are discussed in relation to the changes in our practice prompted by Covid-19 epidemic, with potential implications for other transplant programs.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; early infection; immunosuppression; viral carriage.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":10,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":true,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"15 days after discharge","relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient received a liver transplant 8 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis.

Nasopharyngeal smear specimen resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pulmonary low-dose CT-scan revealed bilateral subpleural ground-glass infiltrates. O2 saturation was 93%. A treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine twice daily was started. The patient received also cefepime and remained in isolation. Seven days later imaging showed a progression of the pulmonary infiltrates. Cefepime was replaced by meropenem. During the following 3 days the fever resolved, and the general conditions of the patient significantly improved. Consequently, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine was stopped. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia in this immunosuppressed patient was moderate to severe and liver injury was not clinically significant. Despite its limitations, this case report confirm that the liver may be only mildly affected during SARS-CoV-2 infection, also in liver transplanted patients.

It is unclear whether solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe complications and how they should be managed, also concerning immunosuppression. This is a report about the course and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients from a single center in Northwestern Italy in the period March-April 2020. Three patients who were treated at our institution are reported in detail, whereas summary data are provided for those managed at peripheral Hospitals. Presentation varied from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, treatment and changes to immunosuppression were adapted to the severity of the disease. Overall mortality was 20%, whereas Covid-related mortality was 10%. Two cases of prolonged (>2 months) viral carriage were observed in two asymptomatic patients who contracted the infection in the early course after transplant. Besides depicting Covid-19 course and possible treatment scenarios in liver transplant patients, these cases are discussed in relation to the changes in our practice prompted by Covid-19 epidemic, with potential implications for other transplant programs.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; early infection; immunosuppression; viral carriage.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":10,"article_patient_number":"8","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":true,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"","clinical_syndrome":"fever","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient had received a liver transplant prior to COVID-19 diagnosis.

However, in particular the role of immunosuppression in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains undetermined. Here, we present a male in 60s COVID-19 patient with recent heart transplantation who developed only mild symptoms, but had prolonged virus shedding, and summarize the available data on COVID-19 in cardiac allograft recipients. Initially the patient presented with a transient episode of fever and sore throat but no other symptoms, in particular no cough or dyspnea at rest. After diagnosis, immunosuppression was continued unchanged. On day 7, his temperature increased again with concurrent mild rise of C-reactive protein, IL-6, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Hydroxychloroquine was started and continued for 7 days. While the patient no longer had clinical symptoms 20 days after initial presentation, virus culture of throat swabs on days 18 and 21 confirmed active virus replication and SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive on day 35 with copy numbers similar to the onset of infection. In conclusion, the immunosuppression regimen in transplant recipients with mild COVID-19-associated symptoms may be continued unchanged. However, it may contribute to delayed virus polymerase chain reaction conversion and thus possible prolonged infectivity.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  clinical research/ practice; heart disease; heart transplantation/ cardiology; immunosuppressant; immunosuppression/ immune modulation; infection and infectious agents - viral; infectious disease.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Germany","country_treated":"Germany","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle, gout","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Heart transplantation in November 2019 for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle.

We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls).

However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls).          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, \r\nP\r\n=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, \r\nP\r\n<0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased. Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n

Herein, we present a simultaneous heart-kidney transplant (SHKT) recipient who was hospitalized for the management of respiratory failure from volume overload complicated by failure to thrive, multiple opportunistic infections, and open non-healing wounds in the setting of worsening renal dysfunction weeks prior to the first case of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in the state of Connecticut. After his third endotracheal intubation, routine nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2, in anticipation of a planned tracheostomy, was positive. His hemodynamics, respiratory status, and ventilator requirements remained stable without any worsening for 4 weeks until he had a negative NAT test. It is possible that the immunocompromised status of our patient may have prevented significant immune activation leading up to clinically significant cytokine storm that could have resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem organ failure.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; immunosuppression; simultaneous heart-kidney transplant.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":null,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Simultaneous heart-kidney transplant for underlying dilated cardiomyopathy from adriamycin treatment and chronic renal failure in January 2020,  acute tubular necrosis (ATN) without rejection after transplant","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"The perinephric collection\r\ngrew out vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and blood cultures revealed MRSA bacteremia.\r\nIn addition, he had developed a low-grade BK Polyoma virus DNAemia (768 copies/mL)\r\nInterestingly, his absolute lymphocyte count was measured to be 319 cells/μL (range: 850 - 3,900\r\ncells/μL), which was higher than 3 weeks prior (0 cells/μL).

The right thrombus was involved in the right sphenoparietal sinus and a right front-temporal decompression surgery was performed. After surgery he was seizure free with 1500 mg/day levetiracetam for five months. He also received anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and a maintenance dose of 20 mg/day prednisone for nephrosis. A week before admission he felt bulging in his skin flap. Just after arrival to the hospital, he had a focal aware seizure that last for a few minutes before administration of 7.5 mg diazopam. Head CT showered severe brain swelling go the right temporal lobe. Chest CT revealed ground-glass opacities. Anti-epileptic and anticoagulation therapies were strengthened to 2000 mg/day levetiracetam and 3/5 mg/day warfarin, which thus far, has prevented further seizures. Follow up head CT two weeks after discharge showed improvement in brain swelling.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6873,8342]},{"id":6414,"regimens":[{"id":12435,"duration":{"id":6434,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10033,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12435},{"id":10034,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":12435},{"id":10035,"answer":"In a novel population (e.g. pediatrics/neonates, pregnant women, immunosuppressed, etc.)","answer_other":"","regimen":12435}],"created":"2020-10-30T21:08:42.946832Z","updated":"2020-11-12T20:25:34.433575Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6414},{"id":12436,"duration":{"id":6435,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8233,"name":"Heparin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8233","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10293,"answer":"It was not used in a new way","answer_other":"","regimen":12436}],"created":"2020-10-30T21:08:42.954848Z","updated":"2020-11-12T20:25:34.486614Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6414},{"id":12437,"duration":{"id":6436,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":11041,"name":"Voriconazole","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11041","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10294,"answer":"It was not used in a new way","answer_other":"","regimen":12437}],"created":"2020-10-30T21:08:42.961462Z","updated":"2020-11-12T20:25:34.487443Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6414},{"id":12438,"duration":{"id":6437,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8971,"name":"Meropenem","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8971","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10295,"answer":"It was not used in a new way","answer_other":"","regimen":12438}],"created":"2020-10-30T21:08:42.967954Z","updated":"2020-11-12T20:25:34.488239Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6414}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8422,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6414}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14388,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6414}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4525,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6414},{"id":4526,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":6414}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-10-30T20:26:50.364465Z","updated":"2020-11-12T20:25:34.425638Z","title":"COVID-19 in lung transplant recipients: A case series from Milan, Italy.Case 3.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32510771,"doi":"10.1111/tid.13356","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32510771/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Morlacchi LC\r\nRossetti V\r\nGigli L\r\nAmati F\r\nRosso L\r\nAliberti S\r\nNosotti M\r\nBlasi F","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society","abstract":"Limited data are currently available regarding the course of COVID-19 in lung and solid organ transplant recipients.

coranovirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become an important health-care issue worldwide. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also raised concerns among patients with inflammatory rheumatic conditions and their treating physicians. There are emerging data regarding the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 for this particular patient group. However, less is known with regard to the course of COVID-19 among patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors. The aim of the current article is to review the growing body of knowledge on the course/management of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases by presenting a SARS-CoV-2 infected case with ankylosing spondylitis under secukinumab therapy. A 61-year old patient with ankylosing spondylitis who was on secukinumab therapy for 5 months admitted with newly onset fever and gastrointestinal complaints. After being hospitalized, she developed respiratory manifestations with focal pulmonary ground-glass opacities and multiple nodular densities in both lungs. The patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Substantial clinical improvement was obtained following a management plan, which included tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone and enoxaparin sodium. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched by using relevant keywords and their combinations. The literature search revealed four articles reporting the clinical course of COVID-19 in seven rheumatic patients on secukinumab. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mild in most of these patients, while one of them experienced severe COVID-19. Interleukin-17 has been related to the hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19 and IL-17 inhibitors were presented as promising targets for the prevention of aberrant inflammation and acute respiratory distress in COVID-19. However, this hypothesis still remains to be proved. Further studies are warranted in order to test the benefits and risks of IL-inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Ankylosing spondylitis; Biological drugs; COVID-19; Interleukin-17; Rheumatic diseases; Secukinumab; Spondyloarthritis.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Turkey","country_treated":"Turkey","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Ankylosing spondylitis on secukinumab","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"She had a history of ankylosing spondylitis dated back 11 years and over the past 5 months, she had been treated with secukinumab with a good clinical response.

While increased sputum secretion could cause airway obstruction during mechanical ventilation, there are few reported cases in the literature. We report a case of a 65-year-old man with diabetes and severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, nafamostat, and prone positioning. Initially, mechanical ventilation consisted of a heat moisture exchanger, endotracheal tube aspiration, and subglottic secretion drainage using a closed suction system. However, endotracheal tube impaction by highly viscous sputum occurred during this mechanical ventilation system. Replacing the endotracheal tube, the use of a humidifier instead of a heat moisture exchanger, and prone positioning contributed to the patient being weaned off mechanical ventilation. Although anti-aerosol measures are important for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, attention should be given to potential endotracheal tube impaction during mechanical ventilation.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  coronavirus 2019 (covid-19); coronavirus disease 2019; covid-19 respiratory failure high altitude pulmonary edema high flow nasal cannula acute respiratory distress syndrome; invasive mechanical ventilation; key words corona; sars cov-2; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2); tube impaction.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Continuation of mechanical ventilation proved difficult after endotracheal tube impaction with highly viscous sputum.

The virus causes a debilitating infection with multiorgan injury and has a high mortality rate estimated to be around 3.70%. Several hypotheses are formulated to explain the liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients which include collateral damage from cytokine storm, drug-induced liver injury, viral-induced hepatitis and hypoxia-induced damage. Through this case series, we would like to highlight that liver enzyme abnormalities are often seen in COVID-19 patients and would like to highlight that physicians need to serially monitor biochemical testing until the liver enzymes return to baseline.

Recent reports suggest that ACE2, which is the target protein to invade the host, has a ubiquitous presence in human organs, including lung parenchyma, gastrointestinal tract, nasal mucosa, renal and urinary tract, airway epithelia, lymphoid tissues, reproductive organs, vascular endothelium and neurons. In this scenario, neurologists are particularly involved into considering even more specific therapeutic strategies according to the available data during the pandemic. In particular, MS patients are usually receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) with immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory effects, which increase the risk of infections and morbidity, compared with the general population.

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo. En todos los casos la radiografía de tórax era patológica con infiltrado unilateral o bilateral. La procalcitonina demostró no ser suficientemente sensible para detectar la infección neumocócica. La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida.

We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020.

Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned.

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned. Nineteen patients had an uneventful recovery (65.5%). In group 1, 3 of 6 patients died (50%) and 1 of 6 required invasive mechanical ventilation (16.7%). In group 2, 3 of 23 patients died (12.5%). Renal function did not deteriorate and signs of rejection were not observed in any patient on the second treatment regime.

We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus.

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned. Nineteen patients had an uneventful recovery (65.5%). In group 1, 3 of 6 patients died (50%) and 1 of 6 required invasive mechanical ventilation (16.7%). In group 2, 3 of 23 patients died (12.5%).

It is important to recognize the comorbidities and risk factors associated with this highly contagious and serious disease that has caused thousands of deaths worldwide.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease that is more prevalent in the elderly population, the same group that are more susceptible to serious complications from COVID-19. Our literature search did not reveal any review about COVID-19 in IPF patients. We report a patient with IPF who was exposed to COVID-19 from her spouse and died from its complications.

throughout a patient's lifetime. Moreover, viral pathogens have been proven to be the leading contributors to myopericarditis in the pediatric and adult populations. Despite the current comprehensive knowledge of myocardial injury in viral and post-viral myopericarditis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced myopericarditis are poorly understood. This report presents a case of coronavirus (COVID-19) fulminant myopericarditis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a middle-aged male patient: a 50-SOME-old man with a history of hypertension who arrived to the emergency department with a dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, resulting in the patient's admission to the airborne isolation unit for clinical observation. When his condition began to deteriorate, the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit after electrocardiography detected cardiac injury, demonstrating diffuse ST-segment elevation. Laboratory evaluations revealed elevated troponin T and BNP, with an echocardiogram indicating global left ventricular hypokinesia and a reduced ejection fraction. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dobutamine, remdesivir, and ventilatory support. This specific case highlights the severity and complications that may arise as a direct result of COVID-19 infection.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  ards; coronavirus disease (covid-19); diffuse st elevation; myocarditis; myopericarditis; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2).","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient deteriorated","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, Heart","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever, diffuse ST elevation, acute myopericarditis","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Unusual disease manifestation by myopericarditis.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5600,6122,6675,7023,7479,8342,8433,9077,11301,11121]},{"id":6612,"regimens":[{"id":13167,"duration":{"id":7057,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11484,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13167},{"id":11485,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13167}],"created":"2020-11-30T19:44:36.179653Z","updated":"2020-12-02T16:19:42.073270Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6612},{"id":13168,"duration":{"id":7058,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11486,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13168},{"id":11487,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13168}],"created":"2020-11-30T19:44:36.187826Z","updated":"2020-12-02T16:19:42.079799Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6612}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8679,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6612}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14986,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6612},{"id":14987,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6612},{"id":14988,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6612}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4789,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6612},{"id":4790,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":6612}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-11-30T19:43:12.910414Z","updated":"2020-12-02T16:19:42.065395Z","title":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients with Down Syndrome, Congenital Heart Disease, and Pulmonary Hypertension: Is Down Syndrome a Risk Factor?

Since the patient refused admission to the hospital and had stable vital signs, we chose to treat him with a safe anti-inflammatory and non-immunosuppressive therapy. To hit two birds with one stone, we considered colchicine, as it has systemic anti-inflammatory effects and is also effective in gout flare. Unexpectedly, 48 hours after treatment, not only did his ongoing fever and toe pain disappear, he also had significant improvements in his general state of health and all his inflammatory markers including fibrinogen, ferritin, D-dimer, and IL-6 levels normalized. To our knowledge, the use of colchicine in Covid-19 and CRS has not been reported. This observation merits the consideration of colchicine as a safe, inexpensive and oral medication for the treatment of mild to moderate CRS in Covid-19 patients. More importantly, in Covid-19 patients with early lung involvement colchicine may be an appropriate candidate to prevent CRS in adjunction with routine antiviral agents. Indeed, multicenter, randomized controlled studies are required to evaluate the benefits of this therapy.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

The patient was in septic shock and respiratory failure on admission requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed patchy bilateral opacities suspicious for viral pneumonia and the COVID-19 sputum sample sent to the New York Department of Health returned positive. This patient's comorbidities, along with his age, placed him in the highest risk of mortality for COVID-19. The patient was managed pharmacologically with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. By Day 5 of his admission, he improved significantly and was extubated and downgraded from the ICU to the medical floor, pending discharge.

Self-limiting respiratory tract involvement, severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure and death are the spectrum of COVID-19. To date, there are no especial therapeutic agents for COVID-19 infections. One such medication includes the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which recently reported as a possible therapy for shortening the duration of COVID-19 symptoms, reducing inflammatory reactions to infection, impairing the exacerbation of pneumonia and boosting lung imaging findings. Like all medications, HCQ has side effects and may occur in COVID-19 patients. Here, we report on the case of a 40-some-old woman, presented with fever and dry cough, who had COVID-19 and 2 days later presented with a pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash, which started from

These manifestations are linked to a hypercoaguable, pro-inflammatory state with persistent, systemic complement activation. Three critical COVID-19 patients recalcitrant to multiple interventions had skin biopsies documenting deposition of the terminal complement component C5b-9, the lectin complement pathway enzyme MASP2, and C4d in microvascular endothelium. Administration of anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab led to a marked decline in D-dimers and neutrophil counts in all three cases, and normalization of liver functions and creatinine in two. One patient with severe heart failure and AKI had a complete remission. The other two individuals had partial remissions, one with resolution of his AKI but ultimately succumbing to respiratory failure, and another with a significant decline in FiO2 requirements, but persistent renal failure. In conclusion, anti-complement therapy may be beneficial in at least some patients with critical COVID-19.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

All patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and were previously healthy. Clinical presentations were similar with fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal complaints, and/or rash. One patient had altered mental status with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings consistent with aseptic meningitis. Laboratory values were remarkable for high levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimers, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin in all patients. All had low albumin levels. Evaluation for other infectious etiologies was negative. All of the patients were critically ill, requiring admission to the intensive care unit. All had circulatory shock and needed inotropes. Two patients had respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support and one had cardiac dysfunction. All patients received steroids, and two received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). One patient received tocilizumab. None of the children died. MIS-C is a recently recognized pediatric illness spectrum in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical characterization is essential for understanding disease mechanisms to inform clinical practice.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"3","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was

The clinical and laboratory data for these patients were extracted.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              One patient in the 10-day group received RDV for only 5 days because of nausea and elevated liver transaminases. No patient had respiratory comorbidity. Seven patients had bilateral lesions and three had unilateral lesions on imaging. All patients had received other medications for COVID-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, before administration of RDV. Five patients required supplemental oxygen and one required mechanical ventilation. All patients showed clinical and laboratory evidence of improvement. Half of the patients developed elevated liver transaminases and three had nausea. There were no adverse events exceeding grade 2.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              Our experience indicates that RDV could be a therapeutic option for COVID-19.

These manifestations are linked to a hypercoaguable, pro-inflammatory state with persistent, systemic complement activation. Three critical COVID-19 patients recalcitrant to multiple interventions had skin biopsies documenting deposition of the terminal complement component C5b-9, the lectin complement pathway enzyme MASP2, and C4d in microvascular endothelium. Administration of anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab led to a marked decline in D-dimers and neutrophil counts in all three cases, and normalization of liver functions and creatinine in two. One patient with severe heart failure and AKI had a complete remission. The other two individuals had partial remissions, one with resolution of his AKI but ultimately succumbing to respiratory failure, and another with a significant decline in FiO2 requirements, but persistent renal failure. In conclusion, anti-complement therapy may be beneficial in at least some patients with critical COVID-19.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

The World Health Organization later named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is no effective treatment available and the data are evolving through continuous clinical trials and ongoing research. Severe infections present with hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome as one of the major complications. We report two cases of COVID-19 patients who initially presented with moderate to severe symptoms. Later, their clinical course worsened despite ongoing treatment with multiple medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin until they were started on tocilizumab. Within a short period after they were administered tocilizumab, their oxygen saturation improved and other inflammatory markers such as D-dimer levels, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels decreased. There is an increase in the amount of research citing the role of various cytokines in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Targeting the inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis, especially interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, would improve overall morbidity and mortality, thus decreasing the burden on healthcare systems.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            covid 19; hypoxemic respiratory failure; inflammation; interleukin (il)-6; novel coronavirus; pathophysiology; pneumonia; sars-cov-2; tocilizumab.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":true,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Atrial fibrillation on apixaban","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Bilateral airspace disease, cough, shortness of breath, fever","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Within 24 hours of Tocilizumab treatment, her fevers started trending down, her oxygen saturation improved to mid-90s, and other inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein started trending down.

\r\n            COVID-19 is a respiratory illness due to novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), described in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and rapidly evolved into a pandemic. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract can also be involved.    \r\n          Case presentation:        \r\n            A 44-year-old man was hospitalised for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A rapid recovery of respiratory and general symptoms was observed after 1 week of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine and broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam plus teicoplanin). No GI symptoms were reported during hospitalisation, but a lung contrast-enhancement CT (CE-CT) excluding thromboembolism showed, as collateral finding, intraperitoneal free bubbles not present on a previous CT examination; the subsequent abdominal CE-CT described pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) involving the caecum and the right colon. Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was started, and the 2-week follow-up CT showed the complete resolution of PI.    \r\n          Discussion:        \r\n            The pathogenesis of PI is poorly understood. PI involving the caecum and right colon has been described for HIV and Cytomegalovirus infections, but, to our best knowledge, never before in COVID-19. We hypothesise a multifactorial aetiopathogenesis for PI, with a possible role of the bowel wall damage and microbiota impairment due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we suggest a conservative management

(Orlando, Fla.)","abstract":"Respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (AKI) are associated with high mortality in SARS-CoV-2-associated Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These manifestations are linked to a hypercoaguable, pro-inflammatory state with persistent, systemic complement activation. Three critical COVID-19 patients recalcitrant to multiple interventions had skin biopsies documenting deposition of the terminal complement component C5b-9, the lectin complement pathway enzyme MASP2, and C4d in microvascular endothelium. Administration of anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab led to a marked decline in D-dimers and neutrophil counts in all three cases, and normalization of liver functions and creatinine in two. One patient with severe heart failure and AKI had a complete remission. The other two individuals had partial remissions, one with resolution of his AKI but ultimately succumbing to respiratory failure, and another with a significant decline in FiO2 requirements, but persistent renal failure. In conclusion, anti-complement therapy may be beneficial in at least some patients with critical COVID-19.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Series","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"3","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[7561,7629,8342,11301,10776]},{"id":6722,"regimens":[{"id":13531,"duration":{"id":7420,"approximate_duration":"10 Days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":12202,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13531},{"id":12203,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13531}],"created":"2020-12-15T16:05:52.893310Z","updated":"2020-12-15T16:31:13.161323Z","dose":"200mg","frequency":"BID","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6722},{"id":13532,"duration":{"id":7421,"approximate_duration":"12 Days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":12204,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13532},{"id":12205,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":13532}],"created":"2020-12-15T16:05:52.901129Z","updated":"2020-12-15T16:31:13.167845Z","dose":"400mg, 100mg","frequency":"BID","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6722}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8838,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6722},{"id":8839,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6722},{"id":8840,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6722}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":15162,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6722},{"id":15163,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6722},{"id":15164,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6722}],"author_username":"Paige Evans","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4934,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6722},{"id":4935,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":6722}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":554,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-12-11T23:26:44.929688Z","updated":"2020-12-15T16:31:13.152997Z","title":"Mild clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia in two patients with multiple sclerosis under treatment with ocrelizumab.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32777745,"doi":"10.1016/j.msard.2020.102442","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32777745/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Iannetta M\r\nCesta N\r\nStingone C\r\nMalagnino V\r\nTeti E\r\nVitale P\r\nDe Simone G\r\nRossi B\r\nAnsaldo L\r\nCompagno M\r\nSpalliera I\r\nDi Lorenzo A\r\nLandi D\r\nNicoletti CG\r\nMarfia GA\r\nAndreoni M\r\nSarmati L","article_author_email":"marco.iannetta@uniroma2.it","journal":"Multiple sclerosis and related disorders","abstract":"Background:        \r\n            Recently SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide causing a pandemic.

Its diagnosis might be challenging. We present two critically ill patients with COVID-19 who presented acutely altered mental status as the main manifestation of multiple strokes.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up of the patients.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Two patients in their sixties were hospitalized with a bilateral pneumonia COVID-19. They developed respiratory failure and were admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilation and intense medical treatment. They were started on low-molecular-weight heparin since admission. Their laboratory results showed lymphopenia and increased levels of C-reactive protein and D-dimer. Case 1 developed hypofibrinogenemia and presented several cutaneous lesions with biopsy features of thrombotic vasculopathy. Case 2 was performed a CT pulmonary angiogram at ICU showing a bilateral pulmonary embolism. When waking up, both patients were conscious but with a remarkable global altered mental status without focal neurological deficits. A brain MRI revealed multiple acute bilateral ischemic lesions with areas of hemorrhagic transformation in both patients (case 1: affecting the left frontal and temporal lobes and both occipital lobes; case 2: affecting both frontal and left occipital lobes). Cardioembolic source and acquired antiphospholipid syndrome were ruled out.

They developed respiratory failure and were admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilation and intense medical treatment. They were started on low-molecular-weight heparin since admission. Their laboratory results showed lymphopenia and increased levels of C-reactive protein and D-dimer. Case 1 developed hypofibrinogenemia and presented several cutaneous lesions with biopsy features of thrombotic vasculopathy. Case 2 was performed a CT pulmonary angiogram at ICU showing a bilateral pulmonary embolism. When waking up, both patients were conscious but with a remarkable global altered mental status without focal neurological deficits.

At present, an effective treatment regimen and vaccination has not been established. Many patients develop severe symptoms requiring endotracheal intubation and a prolonged stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In early postmortem examinations of COVID-19 patients, profuse viscous secretions were observed throughout the respiratory tract. Thus, oxygen supplementation without aggressive pulmonary hygiene management may be suboptimal. In the present case series, pulmonary hygiene management encompassed mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning. We report 3 severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in cruise ship employees who were admitted to the ICU and responded to supportive mechanical ventilation and pulmonary hygiene management. \r\n\r\nCASE REPORT Three cruise ship employees with COVID-19 underwent endotracheal intubation and were admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Initial chest X-rays suggested multifocal pneumonia with superimposed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A regimen of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and dexamethasone was initiated on admission in all cases. Additionally, medications used for pulmonary hygiene were administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in line with the ventilator circuit. Endotracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration. The duration from endotracheal intubation to extubation ranged from 9 to 24 days.

At present, an effective treatment regimen and vaccination has not been established. Many patients develop severe symptoms requiring endotracheal intubation and a prolonged stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In early postmortem examinations of COVID-19 patients, profuse viscous secretions were observed throughout the respiratory tract. Thus, oxygen supplementation without aggressive pulmonary hygiene management may be suboptimal. In the present case series, pulmonary hygiene management encompassed mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning. We report 3 severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in cruise ship employees who were admitted to the ICU and responded to supportive mechanical ventilation and pulmonary hygiene management. \r\n\r\nCASE REPORT Three cruise ship employees with COVID-19 underwent endotracheal intubation and were admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Initial chest X-rays suggested multifocal pneumonia with superimposed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A regimen of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and dexamethasone was initiated on admission in all cases. Additionally, medications used for pulmonary hygiene were administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in line with the ventilator circuit. Endotracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration. The duration from endotracheal intubation to extubation ranged from 9 to 24 days. All 3 patients reached 30-day survival. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS The cases reported highlight the importance of the use of airway hygiene with mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilatory support.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"3","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, anxious, restless, dyspneic","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Tracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration.\r\n\r\nThroughout the remainder of the hospital course, the patient remained on nasal cannula with SpO2 ranging between 98–93%.

Some of them develop a systemic hyperinflammatory state produced by the massive release of inflammatory agents, known as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Inhibition of IL-1 by Anakinra (ANK) is a potential life-saving therapy for severe CSS cases. We propose a rationale for the use of subcutaneous ANK and review our initial experience in a small cohort of severe COVID-19 CSS patients.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients developing ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and exhibiting signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >1000 ng/mL and/or d-dimers > 1.5 μg/mL, plus IL-6 < 40 mg/mL) that received ANK. For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group. Favorable outcome was achieved in 55.6% and 88.9% of the ANK and TCZ cohorts, respectively (p = 0.281). Two patients that failed to respond to TCZ improved after ANK treatment. Aminotransferase levels significantly increased between day 1 and day 7 (p = 0.004) in the TCZ group. Mortality was the same in both groups (11%). There were not any opportunistic infection in the groups nor other adverse effects attributable to treatment.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Overall, 55.6% of COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients treated with ANK exhibited favorable outcome, not inferior to a TCZ treated matched cohort.

The patient was managed by the departments of vascular surgery, anesthesia and intensive care, and the Coagulation Service and Thrombosis Research from San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"Yes","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"The patient was admitted to the Covid-19 ward and treated with noninvasive ventilation, ceftriaxone, and enoxaparin 6,000 anti-Xa IU once a day as antithrombotic prophylaxis. During the first 48 hr, the patient did not show any further clinical deterioration. However, from the third day after the admission, there was a progressive increase of the platelet count (443 × 109/L), D-dimer (3.73 μg/mL), C-reactive protein (229 mg/L), and worsening of the gas exchange. Consequently the patient was intubated and moved to the Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU).\r\n\r\nOn day 5, the patient suffered pain, numbness, and coldness of the right lower limb along with a massive augmentation of the D-dimer (>20 μg/mL). A Duplex ultrasound scan (DUS) showed complete occlusion of the right iliac and femoro-popliteal arteries, for which it performed an emergent revascularization of the lower limb under general anesthesia.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth post-op day, the patient presented a bilateral persistent acroischemia of the lower extremities, including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla, and dry gangrene.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"2

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the clinical course and the therapeutic management of patients with chronic kidney disease and COVID-19 infection. To date, most evidence has come from renal transplantation, with about 45 patients reported thus far, and the current data from the ERA-EDTA (ERACODA) registry for transplanted patients and patients on Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT); as for those with glomerular diseases, data are lacking. Herein, we report the case of a 62-year-old patient with severe membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis who had been receiving a high burden of immunosuppression until four months before the COVID-19 infection. He developed severe disease with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. After treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, despite his low chances, he gradually recovered and survived. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few reported patients with glomerulonephritis who had COVID-19 Besides our single case with glomerulonephritis early during the disease outbreak, the very low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the country's transplant recipients (0.038%) and dialysis patients (0.24%) reflects the impact of the rapid implementation of social distancing rules as well as of preventive measures for disease control in the hospitals and dialysis units in our country.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Greece","country_treated":"Greece","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"25 days after hospitalization","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Remdesivir was not administered because of renal impairment (peak creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL, corresponding to an eGFR of 23 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the CKD-EPI equation).
