Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\r\n\r\nObjective: To describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\r\n\r\nStudy design: We describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\r\n\r\nResults: Among 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).\r\n\r\nConclusion: We report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"5","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"A 30- to 34-year-old previously healthy gravida at 36 0/7 weeks’ gestation was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and gestational diabetes.","pregnant":true,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"A 30- to 34-year-old previously healthy gravida at 36 0/7 weeks’ gestation was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and initiated on ceftriaxone, oseltamivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir. She had experienced mild cold symptoms for 2 weeks before admission and reported being febrile with new onset dyspnea and dry cough on the day before admission. Her medical history was significant for type A2 gestational diabetes and managed on low-dose metformin (500 mg, twice daily). With concern for impending cardiopulmonary collapse, she underwent cesarean delivery of a viable neonate. With persistent hypoxia (SaO2 70%), tachypnea, and impending respiratory collapse, she was intubated 24 hours later, and her antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Over the next 5 days, her cardiopulmonary status worsened despite placement of chest tube, and despite maximal ventilator support, she died 1 day later and 3 hours after an initially successful resuscitation. Her neonate’s pharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. There are 4 other household members in her familial cohort; her 6-year-old son received a diagnosis of clinical COVID-19, and 3 others had prolonged exposure. He recovered, and all are alive and well.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6675,8783,8971,9463,11121]},{"id":5898,"regimens":[{"id":11025,"duration":{"id":5084,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":7518,"name":"Doxycycline","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/7518","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7342,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11025},{"id":8331,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11025}],"created":"2020-09-14T20:02:14.285189Z","updated":"2020-09-27T02:19:53.809565Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5898},{"id":11026,"duration":{"id":5085,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7343,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11026},{"id":8332,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11026}],"created":"2020-09-14T20:02:14.292822Z","updated":"2020-09-27T02:19:53.810433Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5898},{"id":11027,"duration":{"id":5086,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":11121,"name":"Vancomycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11121","rxNorm_id":11124,"notes":""},"use_drug":[{"id":7344,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11027},{"id":8333,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11027}],"created":"2020-09-14T20:02:14.299235Z","updated":"2020-09-27T02:19:53.811240Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5898}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7712,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5898},{"id":7713,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5898}],"how_diagnosis":[],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3833,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5898},{"id":3834,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":5898}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":373,"name":"Tuberculosis"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-09-14T19:50:09.299372Z","updated":"2020-09-27T02:19:53.764528Z","title":"Chest Imaging in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 Infection - A Case Series.

Imaging, including computed tomography is not recommended to screen/diagnose COVID-19 infections, but plays an important role in management of these patients, and to rule out alternative diagnoses or coexistent diseases. In our multicenter case series, we outline the clinical presentations and illustrate the most common imaging manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":8,"article_patient_number":"8","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"Unknown","age":"71-80 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Patient presented to ED with “flu-like symptoms” including productive cough with yellow sputum, SOB, body aches, and subjective fevers.

In Bhutan, the index case was a 76-year-old immunocompromised man who had traveled\r\nfrom the United States and entered Bhutan as a tourist. He presented initially with vague gastrointerestinal symptoms and\r\nlater a cough. His atypical presentation led to a delay in diagnosis, but ultimately he was isolated and tested. On confirming\r\nthe diagnosis of COVID-19, the patient was isolated in a separate hospital with a dedicated medical care team. All\r\ncontacts were traced and quarantined. The patient’s respiratory status deteriorated despite broad-spectrum antivirals,\r\nantibiotics, and intensive supportive care. He required intubation and was given a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin to\r\nmodulate his likely aberrant immune response. Subsequently, the patient’s clinical status improved, and after 8 days of\r\nhospitalization, he was transferred out of the country, where he recovered. This was a learning experience for the treating\r\nmedical staff, the government, and the people of Bhutan.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) support was started and antibiotics were modified to meropenem, vancomycin and clindamycin. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given (2 g/kg) with aspirin (75 mg once-a-day). Echocardiogram did not show any abnormalities and repeat chest Xray showed increased right-sided infiltrates. Repeat nasopharyngeal COVID-19 RT-PCR was positive. Multiplex PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirate detected Coronavirus OC43 and Human Rhino/Enterovirus. As he improved, he was gradually weaned off HFNC. Blood cultures showed no growth and antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. In light of the persistent high-grade fever and elevated CRP (121 mg/L), 72 hours after IVIG infusion, he was given tocilizumab (8 mg/kg IV over 2 hours). Twelve hours later, his fever spikes settled, and inflammatory parameters rapidly decreased to baseline.

On HD #3, his D-dimer was > 10,000 ng/mL (from 501 ng/mL on admission). A heparin infusion was started empirically and titrated to an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.5 IU/mL. With the exception of four anti-Xa levels that were slightly supratherapeutic (0.55–0.73 IU/mL), the level remained within the target range. On HD #5, he was enrolled in a clinical trial and was given sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody, or placebo. His subsequent hospital course was complicated by hypotension with increasing vasopressor requirements and acute kidney injury necessitating initiation of dialysis on HD #10. On HD #13, neurocritical care was consulted due to persistent encephalopathy and concern for absent brainstem reflexes.Non-contrast head CT (NCHCT) demonstrated multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, mass effect, and evidence of global anoxic injury, cerebral edema, and downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils.

He felt generalized fatigue and fever (day 1). He saw doctors nearby twice (day 2 and 5) and was prescribed Laninamivir and antipyretic agents, His family visited his home and found that he was unconsciousness and lying on the floor in his vomit. He was immediately transported to this hospital by ambulance (day 9). Under emergency transport, he had transient generalized seizures that lasted about a minute. He had obvious neck stiffness. The specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab but was detected in a CSF. Anti- HSV 1 and varicella-zoster IgM antibodies were not detected in serum samples. A brain MRI showed hyperintensity along the wall of right lateral ventricle and hyperintense signal changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus, suggesting the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 meningitis.

ventilation. While increased sputum secretion could cause airway obstruction during mechanical ventilation, there are few reported cases in the literature. We report a case of a 65-year-old man with diabetes and severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, nafamostat, and prone positioning. Initially, mechanical ventilation consisted of a heat moisture exchanger, endotracheal tube aspiration, and subglottic secretion drainage using a closed suction system. However, endotracheal tube impaction by highly viscous sputum occurred during this mechanical ventilation system. Replacing the endotracheal tube, the use of a humidifier instead of a heat moisture exchanger, and prone positioning contributed to the patient being weaned off mechanical ventilation. Although anti-aerosol measures are important for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, attention should be given to potential endotracheal tube impaction during mechanical ventilation.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  coronavirus 2019 (covid-19); coronavirus disease 2019; covid-19 respiratory failure high altitude pulmonary edema high flow nasal cannula acute respiratory distress syndrome; invasive mechanical ventilation; key words corona; sars cov-2; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2); tube impaction.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Continuation of mechanical ventilation proved difficult after endotracheal tube impaction with highly viscous sputum.

throughout a patient's lifetime. Moreover, viral pathogens have been proven to be the leading contributors to myopericarditis in the pediatric and adult populations. Despite the current comprehensive knowledge of myocardial injury in viral and post-viral myopericarditis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced myopericarditis are poorly understood. This report presents a case of coronavirus (COVID-19) fulminant myopericarditis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a middle-aged male patient: a 50-SOME-old man with a history of hypertension who arrived to the emergency department with a dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, resulting in the patient's admission to the airborne isolation unit for clinical observation. When his condition began to deteriorate, the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit after electrocardiography detected cardiac injury, demonstrating diffuse ST-segment elevation. Laboratory evaluations revealed elevated troponin T and BNP, with an echocardiogram indicating global left ventricular hypokinesia and a reduced ejection fraction. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dobutamine, remdesivir, and ventilatory support. This specific case highlights the severity and complications that may arise as a direct result of COVID-19 infection.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  ards; coronavirus

The patients received medications at the discretion of the treating physician. In this case series, chest computed tomography scans and electrocardiograms, along with other diagnostic tests were used to evaluate these individuals.
