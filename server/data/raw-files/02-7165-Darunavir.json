radiologic findings in COVID-19 pneumonia have been described in the literature. The predominant lung finding is ground-glass opacities, some with a round morphology. A crazy-paving pattern, consolidation with or without a peripheral halo, air bronchograms, thickened interlobular septa and adjacent pleura are also reported. The abnormalities have a predilection for the peripheral and subpleural regions of the lungs and are commonly bilateral.
