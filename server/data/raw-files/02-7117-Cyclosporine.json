We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned.

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned.
