        "abstract": "Myopericarditis remains a prominent infectious inflammatory disorder throughout a patient's lifetime. Moreover, viral pathogens have been proven to be the leading contributors to myopericarditis in the pediatric and adult populations. Despite the current comprehensive knowledge of myocardial injury in viral and post-viral myopericarditis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced myopericarditis are poorly understood. This report presents a case of coronavirus (COVID-19) fulminant myopericarditis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a middle-aged male patient: a 50-SOME-old man with a history of hypertension who arrived to the emergency department with a dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, resulting in the patient's admission to the airborne isolation unit for clinical observation. When his condition began to deteriorate, the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit after electrocardiography detected cardiac injury, demonstrating diffuse ST-segment elevation. Laboratory evaluations revealed elevated troponin T and BNP, with an echocardiogram indicating global left ventricular hypokinesia and a reduced ejection fraction. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dobutamine, remdesivir, and ventilatory support. This specific case highlights the severity and complications that may arise as a direct result of COVID-19 infection.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  ards; coronavirus disease (covid-19); diffuse st elevation; myocarditis; myopericarditis; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2).",

Self-limiting respiratory tract involvement, severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure and death are the spectrum of COVID-19. To date, there are no especial therapeutic agents for COVID-19 infections. One such medication includes the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which recently reported as a possible therapy for shortening the duration of COVID-19 symptoms, reducing inflammatory reactions to infection, impairing the exacerbation of pneumonia and boosting lung imaging findings. Like all medications, HCQ has side effects and may occur in COVID-19 patients. Here, we report on the case of a 40-some-old woman, presented with fever and dry cough, who had COVID-19 and 2 days later presented with a pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash, which started from the distal of upper extremities and rapidly, involved the entire body.",
