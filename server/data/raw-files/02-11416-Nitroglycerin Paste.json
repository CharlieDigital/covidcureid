novel clinical manifestations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Often, extrapulmonary manifestations occur simultaneously with pulmonary disease. However, there is a paucity of literature describing the cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 in the absence of pulmonary findings. We report a rare case of acute pericarditis presenting with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in a 43-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19. This case emphasizes the importance of continued investigation regarding diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and its related symptoms.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  covid-19; pericardial effusion; pericarditis; sars-cov-2; tamponade.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Yes","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Heart, Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Unusual clinical presentation by pericardial effusion.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"One month","relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"The patient was discharged home in stable condition with colchicine 0.6 mg two times daily for three months and ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily with plans for a gradual taper following complete resolution of symptoms and CRP normalization. \r\n\r\nOne month following discharge, repeat echocardiogram showed complete resolution of his pericardial effusion.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6038,7023,8233,8375,11416]}]
