We found that the first patient in this family had Wuhan city travel history. Close contact in daily life was the route of infection. The most common symptoms were fever, cough and weakness. Characteristic imaging changes were found with grass opacity (GGO), consolidation and septal thickening mainly distributed in peripheral and posterior area by thoracic CT scan in the 3 patients. The abnormality in laborotary test included lower white blood cell count, neutrophil count and lymphocyte count，increasing fibrinogen and C-reactive protein，decreasing myohaemoglobin and increasing lactate dehydrogenase. The epidemiological and clinical features could provide quicker diagnosis and better management for the COVID-19 infected patients.\r\nCopyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).","article_type":"","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":false,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"None","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Lower respiratory tract infection","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":true,"when_reminder":"2 weeks","additional_info":"Ever on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: N\r\nAuthor defined severe?: NR\r\nJustification for author-indicated response: \"The clinical symptoms of 3 patients were relieved, and the chest lesions were clearly absorbed and improved\"\r\nDay in disease course that symptoms were noted to begin improving: NR\r\nDay in disease course that full resolution of symptoms was noted: NR\r\nDay in disease course that patient was discharged if admitted: 16\r\nJustification for timing of resolution: Table 1","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8459,11328]}]
