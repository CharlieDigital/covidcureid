Infections with SARS‐CoV‐2 in at risk populations, especially patients with chronic diseases, represent a major healthcare challenge. Of these, severe asthma is of special concern, not only because of the underlying airway disease, but also because of the use of immunomodulatory medications. Over the last years, several types of highly potent immunomodulatory antibodies (biologics) have been approved for the treatment of severe asthma which can improve asthma control and reduce exacerbations and the need for treatments with side effects prone systemic corticosteroids. However, the impact and safety of a treatment with biologics during SARS‐CoV‐2 infections is currently unknown. Here, we report, for the first time, a case of COVID‐19 during treatment with the anti‐IgE antibody omalizumab.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Germany","country_treated":"Germany","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":true,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Severe, early‐onset allergic asthma (main allergen: house dust mites) on Omalizumab","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory Tract Infection","severity":"Outpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Because there was neither shortness of breath nor dyspnea nor any evidence of pneumonia or worsening asthma, he was sent for home quarantine.
