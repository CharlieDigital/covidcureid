Here we report the first family case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confirmed in Wuhan and treated using the combination of western medicine and Chinese traditional patent medicine Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (SHL). This report describes the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of three cases from a family, suggests the expected therapeutic effects of SHL on COVID-19, and warrants further clinical trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, Diarrhea, Vomiting, Febrile","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"The patient was not previously treated for this infection","unusual":"Patient 2 of a family cluster of 3.

On January 26, the patient presented mild weakness, diarrhea, and low fever, and she started to take oral Jinyebaidu granules, oseltamivir, moxifloxacin, and arbidol. On the next day, all her symptoms aggravated with body temperature reaching to 38.3 °C, frequent vomiting, and diarrhea for 5 times a day. At the night of January 27, her body temperature reached 39.5 °C with chest tightness and shortness of breath. Although she took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (loxoprofen), her fever remained high (39 °C). On January 28, her chest CT scan showed consolidation shadow in the left lung, and her 2019-nCoV\r\ntest showed negative using nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Considering her contact history with her mother, she was also confined into an isolation ward and started to take SHL 20 mL once for three times a day without taking other drugs. Her body temperature ranged from 37.5 °C to38.5 °C during January 29 to 31 and decreased from 37.5 °C to 36.5 °C on February 1. All other symptoms resolved on February 2 with recovered appetite and spirit. Two repeated 2019-nCoV tests were negative (Table 1).\r\nOn February 6, her second chest CT scan showed the absorption of the left lung shadow (Fig. 3). After her disease symptoms disappeared, the oral dose of SHL reduced to 10 mL once for three times a day.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[11318,9197,9463,11307,10942]}]
