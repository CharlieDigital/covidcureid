Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered. All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. These data provide insight into the natural history of SARS-CoV-2. Although infectiousness is unclear, highest viral RNA levels were identified in the first week of illness.

A request for compassionate use remdesivir was submitted on the same hospital day as the positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction result.

Late initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating SARS-CoV-2, unlike antivirals utilized for different disease states, such as oseltamivir, that are most effective when started as soon as possible following symptom onset.

According to the ACR guidelines issued shortly after this disease was declared a pandemic, radiologists are expected to familiarize themselves with the CT appearance of COVID-19 infection in order to be able to identify specific findings of this entity. This case report discusses the relevant imaging findings of one of the first cases in the mid-western United States. It involves a 60-year-old man who presented with fever, dyspnea, and cough for 1 week and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. The utility of the noncontrast CT chest in the diagnosis of COVID-19 has been controversial, but there are specific imaging findings that have been increasingly associated with this virus in the appropriate clinical context. The stages of imaging findings in COVID-19 are considered along with the implications of fibrosis throughout the stages.

We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.          \r\n        Findings:      \r\n              The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log\r\n10\r\n copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma.

Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log\r\n10\r\n copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.          \r\n        Interpretation:      \r\n              We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.          \r\n        Funding:      \r\n              REACTing (Research & Action Emerging Infectious Diseases).","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

We hypothesized that patient outcomes would be improved at our tertiary cardiothoracic surgery referral center with a protocolized team-approach for ECMO treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              A 51-year-old healthy female developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) bilateral pneumonia while vacationing in Colorado with her family. She was transferred to our facility for a higher level of care. Her respiratory status continued to deteriorate despite maximized critical care, including prone positioning ventilation and nitric oxide inhalation therapy. Veno-venous ECMO was initiated on hospital day 7 in conjunction with a 10-day course of compassionate use antiviral treatment with remdesivir. The patient's condition improved significantly and she was decannulated from ECMO on hospital day 17 (ECMO day 11). She was successfully extubated and eventually discharged to rehabilitation on hospital day 28.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              This case report demonstrates a positive outcome in a young patient with COVID-19 treated by the judicious application of ECMO in conjunction with compassionate use antiviral treatment (remdesivir).

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

Clinical course seemed favorable in three of our patients, but one of them deteriorated after 10 days of hospitalization, probably due to an acute form of graft dysfunction triggered both by COVID-19 and a nosocomial bacterial infection, and eventually died.

populations emphasized a mild course of disease with severe cases disproportionately affecting infant and comorbid pediatric patients. After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by a SARS-CoV-2-positive female child who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal dysfunction and fluid-refractory hypotension requiring vasopressors and PICU admission.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Child; Coronavirus; Enoxaparin; Pediatric; Remdesivir; Septic; Shock; Tocilizumab.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"11-15 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, Multi-Organ","clinical_syndrome":"Toxic shock syndrome, multi-organ injury, systemic inflammation, fever, rash, abdomen pain, malaise","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6665,6928,11339,8412,9780,11301,10776]},{"id":6454,"regimens":[{"id":12586,"duration":{"id":6580,"approximate_duration":"9 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":11301,"name":"Remdesivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11301","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10381,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12586}],"created":"2020-11-13T19:12:05.546082Z","updated":"2020-11-13T22:30:56.792903Z","dose":"100 mg","frequency":"QD","route":"IV","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6454}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8484,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6454}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14498,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6454},{"id":14499,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6454},{"id":14500,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6454}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4586,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6454}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":495,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-11-13T19:11:42.359235Z","updated":"2020-11-13T22:30:56.784733Z","title":"Flight of the COVID-19 patient: experience with a Wuhan evacuee: a case report.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32527327,"doi":"10.1186/s13256-020-02396-8","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32527327/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Segar S\r\nBouland D\r\nTorriani F\r\nKwak K\r\nAsudani D\r\nTaplitz R\r\nGupta V","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"Journal of medical case reports","abstract":"Background:      \r\n              Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              We report a case of a 51-year-old Chinese woman who was evacuated from Wuhan, China and diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 infection at a Southern California quarantine facility.

throughout a patient's lifetime. Moreover, viral pathogens have been proven to be the leading contributors to myopericarditis in the pediatric and adult populations. Despite the current comprehensive knowledge of myocardial injury in viral and post-viral myopericarditis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced myopericarditis are poorly understood. This report presents a case of coronavirus (COVID-19) fulminant myopericarditis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a middle-aged male patient: a 50-SOME-old man with a history of hypertension who arrived to the emergency department with a dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, resulting in the patient's admission to the airborne isolation unit for clinical observation. When his condition began to deteriorate, the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit after electrocardiography detected cardiac injury, demonstrating diffuse ST-segment elevation. Laboratory evaluations revealed elevated troponin T and BNP, with an echocardiogram indicating global left ventricular hypokinesia and a reduced ejection fraction. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dobutamine, remdesivir, and ventilatory support. This specific case highlights the severity and complications that may arise as a direct result of COVID-19 infection.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  ards; coronavirus disease (covid-19); diffuse st elevation; myocarditis; myopericarditis; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2).","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient deteriorated","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, Heart","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever, diffuse ST elevation, acute myopericarditis","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Unusual disease manifestation by myopericarditis.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5600,6122,6675,7023,7479,8342,8433,9077,11301,11121]},{"id":6659,"regimens":[{"id":13322,"duration":{"id":7211,"approximate_duration":"13 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":11301,"name":"Remdesivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11301","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11815,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13322}],"created":"2020-12-02T21:46:36.991504Z","updated":"2020-12-02T21:55:06.858245Z","dose":"200mg loading dose, then 100mg for 12 days","frequency":"QD","route":"IV","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"Intubation and mechanical ventilation","comments":null,"report":6659}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8738,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6659},{"id":8739,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6659}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":15025,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6659},{"id":15026,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6659}],"author_username":"Paige Evans","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4847,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6659}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":532,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-12-02T20:40:34.739445Z","updated":"2020-12-02T21:55:06.850006Z","title":"Pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in two critically ill patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls).

Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls.

Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronovirus; Intestine; Microbe; Yeast.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":30,"article_patient_number":"22","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Hong Kong","country_treated":"Hong Kong","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, fever, cough, sore throat","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient had a severe case of COVID-19.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[11301]},{"id":6685,"regimens":[{"id":13395,"duration":{"id":7284,"approximate_duration":"4 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":11301,"name":"Remdesivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11301","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":11954,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":13395},{"id":11956,"answer":"In a new dose, for a novel duration, or by a new route of administration","answer_other":"","regimen":13395},{"id":11955,"answer":"In a novel population (e.g. pediatrics/neonates, pregnant women, immunosuppressed, etc.)","answer_other":"","regimen":13395}],"created":"2020-12-04T14:14:38.516144Z","updated":"2020-12-04T14:24:03.131869Z","dose":"2.5 mg/kg","frequency":"QD","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6685}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8783,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6685},{"id":8784,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6685}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":15088,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6685},{"id":15089,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6685},{"id":15090,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6685}],"author_username":"Eleanor McCartney","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4873,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6685}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-12-04T14:13:54.501776Z","updated":"2020-12-04T14:24:03.124126Z","title":"Remdesivir during induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32652563,"doi":"10.1111/bjh.17014","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32652563/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Orf K\r\nRogosic S\r\nDexter D\r\nAncliff P\r\nBadle S\r\nBrierley J\r\nCheng D\r\nDalton C\r\nDixon G\r\nDu Pré P\r\nGrandjean L\r\nGhorashian S\r\nMittal P\r\nO'Connor D\r\nPavasovic V\r\nRao A\r\nSamarasinghe S\r\nVora A\r\nBamford A\r\nBartram J","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"British journal of haematology","abstract":"The COVID‐19 pandemic potentially makes treatment of acute leukaemia more difficult.

These manifestations are linked to a hypercoaguable, pro-inflammatory state with persistent, systemic complement activation. Three critical COVID-19 patients recalcitrant to multiple interventions had skin biopsies documenting deposition of the terminal complement component C5b-9, the lectin complement pathway enzyme MASP2, and C4d in microvascular endothelium. Administration of anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab led to a marked decline in D-dimers and neutrophil counts in all three cases, and normalization of liver functions and creatinine in two. One patient with severe heart failure and AKI had a complete remission. The other two individuals had partial remissions, one with resolution of his AKI but ultimately succumbing to respiratory failure, and another with a significant decline in FiO2 requirements, but persistent renal failure.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used controller medications in patients with asthma. It is unclear whether ICS use increases the risk for severe COVID-19 infection. At the current time, asthma organizations are still recommending the continued use of ICS and other asthma medications to minimize the risk of uncontrolled asthma. However, for patients with asthma and who have recovered from COVID-19 infection, the timing of resumption of asthma therapy is equally uncertain. Pulmonary function testing and exhaled oral nitric oxide testing are aerosol-generating procedures and are currently being severely restricted at most health-care facilities. We presented a case of a patient with cough-variant asthma who developed severe COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome with the need for intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation. We highlighted the potential utility of using COVID-19 RNA detection as well as immunoglobulin G antibody testing to help guide the timing of resumption of asthma therapy.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":true,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"The patient traveled to Madrid, Spain, and 5 days later on return, he developed fever, myalgia, and cough.
