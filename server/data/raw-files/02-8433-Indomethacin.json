throughout a patient's lifetime. Moreover, viral pathogens have been proven to be the leading contributors to myopericarditis in the pediatric and adult populations. Despite the current comprehensive knowledge of myocardial injury in viral and post-viral myopericarditis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced myopericarditis are poorly understood. This report presents a case of coronavirus (COVID-19) fulminant myopericarditis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a middle-aged male patient: a 50-SOME-old man with a history of hypertension who arrived to the emergency department with a dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, resulting in the patient's admission to the airborne isolation unit for clinical observation. When his condition began to deteriorate, the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit after electrocardiography detected cardiac injury, demonstrating diffuse ST-segment elevation. Laboratory evaluations revealed elevated troponin T and BNP, with an echocardiogram indicating global left ventricular hypokinesia and a reduced ejection fraction. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dobutamine, remdesivir, and ventilatory support. This specific case highlights the severity and complications that may arise as a direct result of COVID-19 infection.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  ards; coronavirus disease (covid-19); diffuse st elevation; myocarditis; myopericarditis; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2).","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient deteriorated","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, Heart","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever, diffuse ST elevation, acute myopericarditis","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Unusual disease manifestation by myopericarditis.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5600,6122,6675,7023,7479,8342,8433,9077,11301,11121]}]
