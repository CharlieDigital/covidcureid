After contacting a public health center on January 25, he was isolated in a negative pressure room at Myongji Hospital and confirmed to have COVID-19 on January 26.\r\n\r\nAt that time the initial confirmation of COVID-19 was made by pan-coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction assay and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons using a throat swab.\r\n\r\nThe index patient transmitted the virus to his friend (patient A) at a restaurant on the 1st day of the symptoms. And then patient A (confirmed on January 30, 2020) transmitted COVID-19 to his spouse and son (confirmed on January 31, 2020), and a church colleague (confirmed on February 6, 2020). Those were the first cases of tertiary transmission of COVID-19 outside China.\r\n\r\nThe index patient was a clothing worker at the Wuhan Fashion Center, with a height of 193 cm and weight of 96 kg (body mass index, 25.7), and had no major illness. He denied any smoking and drinking history.\r\n\r\nOn admission day, he had no respiratory symptoms and blood pressure of 152/93 mmHg, pulse rate of 73 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.0°C. On physical examination, no pharyngeal injection, clear lung sounds, and no haziness on chest X-ray were observed. Tests for Leptospira, Hantan virus, Tsutsugamushi, Malaria, M tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Ag/Ab, and venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test were all negative.\r\n\r\nHe developed fever and dry cough on days 5 and 7 of illness, respectively, but he had no serious respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, productive sputum or chest pain. Small consolidation in right upper lobe and ground-glass opacities in both lower lobes were observed on high-resolution computed tomography scan.\r\n\r\nThe initial viral load could not be measured because real-time PCR was not available when the patient was diagnosed. So we measured viral loads using quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR since Jan. 31, 2020. Viral RNA was extracted from the sputum using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All quantitative real-time PCR amplifications were performed using Quantstudio 1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and PowerCheck™ SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time PCR kit (KogeneBiotech, Seoul, Korea).\r\n\r\nThere were some reports about lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) for the treatment of COVID-19.1\r\nLopinavir/ritonavir was started from the hospital day 8 (day 10 of illness); 2 tablets (lopinavir 200 mg/ritonavir 50 mg) were given per oral bid. Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).  It is possible that the decreased load of SARS-CoV-2 resulted from the natural course of the healing process rather than administration of lopinavir/ritonavir, or both. Therefore, more data need to be collected to figure out the direct effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on treatment with COVID-19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: No\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that symptoms were noted to begin improving: 11\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that full resolution of symptoms was noted: 18\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that patient was discharged if admitted: 19\r\n\r\nJustification for timing of resolution: Admitted on Jan 25, 2020. Lopinavir/ritonavir started on Feb 1, 2020. Discharged on Feb 10, 2020.  Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6675,8711,8783,9640,10547]},{"id":5382,"regimens":[{"id":9970,"duration":{"id":4079,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5742,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9970},{"id":5743,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":9970}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:32.390281Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:18.856256Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"Oral","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5382},{"id":9971,"duration":{"id":4080,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9077,"name":"Methylprednisolone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9077","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5744,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9971},{"id":5745,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":9971}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:32.395889Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:10.457658Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5382},{"id":9972,"duration":{"id":4081,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9780,"name":"Piperacillin-Tazobactam","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9780","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5746,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9972},{"id":5747,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":9972}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:32.401240Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:10.468852Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5382}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7077,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5382},{"id":7078,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5382},{"id":7079,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5382}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":11746,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5382},{"id":11832,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5382},{"id":11833,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5382}],"author_username":"CURE ID Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3199,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5382}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:32.376629Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:19:55.887690Z","title":"Changes of CT findings in a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia patient.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32073631,"doi":"10.1093/qjmed/hcaa038","article_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32073631","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Fang X, Zhao M, Li S, Yang L, Wu B","article_author_email":"","journal":"QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians","abstract":"The gold standard for diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is the new coronavirus nucleic acid in swabs, sputum, secretions from the lower respiratory tract or blood.

He has been living in Chengdu, Sichuan province, for a long time. However, his mother had traveled to Wuhan a week ago and was diagnosed with the new coronavirus after she got back home. He has referred to the emergency department of our institution on 2 February 2020. General physical examination showed that moist rales were audible over both lungs, and the body temperature was 36.7C, and other results were unremarkable. The laboratory tests showed that white blood cell count kept in the normal range (5.11  109/l), and the differential count showed decreased lymphocyte (16.8%, normal range 20–50%) and increased C-reactive protein (22.50 mg/l; normal\r\nrange <5 mg/l). Chest computed tomography (CT) (2 February 2020) showed that there were ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both in bilateral lungs (Figure 1A). Considering the contact history with his mother and the CT features, a real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient’s throat swab was performed, and the patient was confirmed with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving 3 days of treatment with an antiviral (Veletonavir, [also known as Lopinavir-Ritonavir]), and anti-inflammatory (Methylprednisolone), the patient’s cough was relieved, and repeated chest CT (5 February 2020) showed the extent and density of lesions were significantly decreased (Figure 1B). Laboratory tests, however, showed that lymphocytes were still reduced, and erythrocyte sedimentation\r\nrate was increased. On 6 February 2020, the patient began to have a fever (body temperature 38.6C) then additional antibiotics (Piperacillin–tazobactam) was given. Unfortunately, 2 days later, the patient’s body temperature reached a maximum of 39.0C, accompanied by a paroxysmal cough, and the whole body’s skin was flushing.

In general, COVID-19 is an acute resolved disease but it can also be deadly, with a 2% case fatality rate. Severe disease onset might result in death due to massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure.2,3 As of Feb 15, about 66580 cases have been confirmed and over\r\n1524 deaths. However, no pathology has been reported due to barely accessible autopsy or biopsy.2,3 Here, we investigated the pathological characteristics of a patient who died from severe infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by postmortem biopsies. This study is in accordance with regulations issued by the National Health Commission of China and the Helsinki Declaration. Our findings will facilitate understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and improve clinical strategies against the disease.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"None reported","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, Febrile, hypoxaemia and shortness of breath, Sudden cardiac arrest","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"[Upon autopsy] Biopsy samples were taken from lung, liver, and heart tissue of the patient. Histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates (figure 2A, B). The right lung showed evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; figure 2A). The left lung tissue displayed\r\npulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation, suggestive of early-phase ARDS (figure 2B). Interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, were seen in both lungs. Multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterised by large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli were identified in the intraalveolar spaces, showing viral cytopathic-like changes. No obvious intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions\r\nwere identified. \r\n\r\nThe pathological features of COVID-19 greatly resemble those seen in SARS and Middle Eastern\r\nrespiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection.4,5 In addition, the liver biopsy specimens of the patient with COVID-19 showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity (figure 2C), indicating the injury could have been caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury.

He reported a travel history to Wuhan Jan 8–12, and that he had initial\r\nsymptoms of mild chills and dry cough on Jan 14 (day 1 of illness) but did not see a doctor and kept working until Jan 21 (figure 1). Chest x-ray showed multiple patchy shadows in both lungs (appendix p 2), and a throat swab sample was taken. On Jan 22 (day 9 of illness), the Beijing Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed by reverse real-time PCR assay that the patient had COVID-19. He was immediately admitted to the isolation ward and received supplemental oxygen through a face mask. He\r\nwas given interferon alfa-2b (5 million units twice daily, atomisation inhalation) and lopinavir plus ritonavir (500 mg twice daily, orally) as antiviral therapy, and moxifloxacin (0·4 g once daily, intravenously) to prevent secondary infection. Given the serious shortness of breath and hypoxaemia, methylprednisolone (80 mg twice daily, intravenously) was administered to attenuate lung inflammation. Laboratory tests results are listed in the appendix (p 4). After receiving medication, his body temperature reduced from 39·0 to 36·4 °C. However, his cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue did not improve. On day 12 of illness, after initial presentation, chest x-ray showed progressive infiltrate and diffuse gridding shadow in both lungs. He refused ventilator support in the intensive care unit repeatedly because he suffered from claustrophobia; therefore, he received high-flow nasal cannula\r\n(HFNC) oxygen therapy (60% concentration, flow rate 40 L/min). On day 13 of illness, the patient’s symptoms had still not improved, but oxygen saturation remained above 95%. In the afternoon of day 14 of illness, his hypoxaemia and shortness of breath worsened. Despite receiving HFNC oxygen therapy (100% concentration, flow rate 40 L/min), oxygen saturation values decreased to 60%, and the patient had sudden cardiac arrest.

This is compatible with serious reported cases, where\r\npneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection. It is characterized primarily by fever and cough, but it is usually accompanied by dyspnea, and bilateral instead of unilateral infiltrates on chest imaging.7 This could be related to the fact that he had a normal total lymphocyte count, and that the severity of the disease has been associated with lymphopenia.8 His conjunctivitis is also an infrequent symptom, that could be explained by evidence that the virus may be present in conjunctival secretions, with around 0.8%of cases presenting with conjunctival congestion.9-13\r\n\r\nOur protocol at patient admission recommended screening for SARS-Cov2 in (1) patients presenting respiratory symptoms and epidemiologic risk of contact with infected or contagious individuals and (2) patients presenting with pneumonia of unknown origin.

Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: \r\nAll different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.\r\n\r\n© 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

The cold-like symptoms rapidly improved, whereas cough with little white sputum appeared the next day. The RT-PCR assay of a throat swab specimen tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on January 27, and the patient was immediately hospitalized. On admission, physical examinations and pulmonary auscultation were normal; laboratory tests indicated a reduction in leukocytes (1.92 × 10^9 /L), neutrophils (1.20 × 10^9\r\n/L), lymphocytes (0.47 × 10^9/L), and eosinophils (0 × 10^9/L) counts, normal CRP, and PCT concentrations, and slightly increased concentration of serum amyloid A [SAA, 36.84 mg/L, reference range: (0 ~ 10) mg/L].

We report a case of COVID-19 infection in a 64-year-old man who developed rapidly worsening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that required intubation. As the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges widely from mild illness to ARDS with a high risk of mortality, there is a need for more research to identify early markers of disease severity. Current evidence suggests that patients with advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities or dyspnoea should be closely monitored, especially at 1-2 weeks after symptom onset. It remains to be seen if laboratory findings such as lymphopenia or elevated lactate dehydrogenase may serve as early surrogates for critical illness or markers of disease recovery. Management of ARDS in COVID-19 remains supportive while we await results of drug trials. More studies are needed to understand the incidence and outcomes of ARDS and critical illness from COVID-19, which will be important for critical care management and resource planning.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Singapore","country_treated":"Singapore","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"None","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Presented with fall  that was preceded by dizziness.

In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord.\r\n\r\nPatients and methods: This is a case series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and severe pneumonia or ARDS who were treated with up to 4 infusions of eculizumab as an off-label agent. Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day + Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV).\r\n\r\nResults: We treated four COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe pneumonia or ARDS. All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab. Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers. Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":4,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"The treatment scheme was:\r\nlopinavir 800 mg/day + ritonavir 200 mg/day, vitamin C6 g/day for 4 days + hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day + eculizumab 900 mg 2 doses, enoxaparin 4000 IU/day subcutaneous, CPAP (NIV) + ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV.

In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord.\r\n\r\nPatients and methods: This is a case series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and severe pneumonia or ARDS who were treated with up to 4 infusions of eculizumab as an off-label agent. Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day + Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV).\r\n\r\nResults: We treated four COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe pneumonia or ARDS. All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab. Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers. Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19.

We describe 20 kidney transplant recipients (median age 59 years [inter quartile range 51-64 years], median age of transplant 13 years [9-20 years], baseline eGFR 36.5 [23-47.5]) with SARS-CoV2 induced pneumonia. At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function. At baseline, all patients presented fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing. Half of patients showed chest radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates while the other half showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates. During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy. Six patients developed acute kidney injury with one requiring hemodialysis. Six of 12 patients were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor. Overall, five kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days [15-19] from symptom onset. These preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. Thus, in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients, SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by high risk of progression and significant mortality.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":20,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was

Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nTo describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\r\nStudy Design\r\n\r\nWe describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nAmong 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization.

The SARS-CoV-2 testing was done, but her test results were not positive until the day of death. Nonetheless, she was initiated on oseltamivir, azithromycin, and ceftazidime at the time of admission. She experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 24 hours later and was transferred to the ICU and intubated; linezolid and amantadine were added. Later that evening, onset of spontaneous labor accompanied persistent oxygen desaturations (SaO2 88% on ventilator support), with spontaneous vaginal delivery of an intrauterine fetal death (IUFD, stillbirth) the following morning. With persistent postpartum ARDS (SaO2 85%–90% on maximal ventilator support), meropenem, vancomycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir were added.

With persistent hypoxia (SaO2 70%), tachypnea, and impending respiratory collapse, she was intubated 24 hours later, and her antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Over the next 5 days, her cardiopulmonary status worsened despite placement of chest tube, and despite maximal ventilator support, she died 1 day later and 3 hours after an initially successful resuscitation. Her neonate’s pharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. There are 4 other household members in her familial cohort; her 6-year-old son received a diagnosis of clinical COVID-19, and 3 others had prolonged exposure. He recovered, and all are alive and well.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6675,8783,8971,9463,11121]},{"id":5827,"regimens":[{"id":10859,"duration":{"id":4917,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7063,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10859},{"id":7064,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10859}],"created":"2020-09-09T00:49:17.237464Z","updated":"2020-09-09T01:12:38.327336Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5827},{"id":10860,"duration":{"id":4918,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9463,"name":"Oseltamivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9463","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7065,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10860},{"id":7066,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10860}],"created":"2020-09-09T00:49:17.246219Z","updated":"2020-09-09T01:12:38.334250Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5827},{"id":10861,"duration":{"id":4919,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7067,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10861},{"id":7068,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10861}],"created":"2020-09-09T00:49:17.252853Z","updated":"2020-09-09T01:12:38.341619Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5827},{"id":10866,"duration":{"id":4920,"approximate_duration":"3 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8412,"name":"Immunoglobulins, Intravenous","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8412","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7077,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10866},{"id":7078,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10866}],"created":"2020-09-09T01:12:38.368806Z","updated":"2020-09-09T01:12:38.374204Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"IV","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5827}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":12924,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5827},{"id":12925,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5827},{"id":12926,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5827}],"author_username":"Parvesh Paul","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.","author_country":"India","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3746,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5827}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":148,"answer":"Other","answer_other":"Middle eastern"}],"created":"2020-09-09T00:42:57.690943Z","updated":"2020-09-09T01:12:38.317881Z","title":"Maternal death due to COVID-19.

Antiviral therapy was initiated with inhaled interferon alfa-2b (IFN-α2b) followed by lopinavir/ritonavir (500 mg orally, twice daily) on the following day (DOI 10). In addition, empirical antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was initiated. Next day, pt developed diarrhea. Intravenous rehydration, oral probiotic supplement, antimotility agents and nutritional support were commenced. Pt deteriorated and to increase the leukocyte count, the patient was administered a subcutaneous injection of 300 µg of human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which was discontinued 4 days later. Given the exacerbation of the patient's symptoms, empirical IVIG (20 g) and thymalfasin were initiated. Corticosteroids (80 mg intravenous methylprednisolone) were also commenced, which was halved to 40 mg two days later.

Case presentation: A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy.       \r\nDiscussion:      \r\nBlood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients. Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19. All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test.

outbreak with coronavirus 2019 began since 31 December 2019. Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections that respiratory complications are the most obvious symptoms. In this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time. We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it.

response, and the initial molding of the public perception toward this pandemic. In Bhutan, the index case was a 76-year-old immunocompromised man who had traveled\r\nfrom the United States and entered Bhutan as a tourist. He presented initially with vague gastrointerestinal symptoms and\r\nlater a cough. His atypical presentation led to a delay in diagnosis, but ultimately he was isolated and tested. On confirming\r\nthe diagnosis of COVID-19, the patient was isolated in a separate hospital with a dedicated medical care team. All\r\ncontacts were traced and quarantined. The patient’s respiratory status deteriorated despite broad-spectrum antivirals,\r\nantibiotics, and intensive supportive care.

While clinical reports from China to date demonstrate that the majority of cases remain relatively mild and recover with supportive care, it is also crucial to be well prepared for severe cases warranting intensive care. Initiating appropriate infection control measures may not always be achievable in primary care or in acute-care settings.          \r\n        Case:      \r\n              A 45-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe pneumonia, later confirmed as COVID-19. His initial evaluation in the resuscitation room and treatments in the intensive care unit was performed under droplet and contact precaution with additional airborne protection using the N95 respirator mask. He was successfully treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory support; and antiretroviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. His total intensive care unit stay was 15 days and was discharged on hospital day 24.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              Strict infection control precautions are not always an easy task, especially under urgent care in an intensive care unit. However, severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, or another novel infectious disease, could present at any moment and would be a continuing challenge to pursue appropriate measures. We need to be well prepared to secure healthcare workers from exposure to infectious diseases and nosocomial spread, as well as to provide necessary intensive care.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":true,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"Bradycardia with atrioventricular block was noted on the 2nd day of LPV/RTV treatment.

There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              When the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS-CoV-2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms that could be a manifestation of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions. Both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, and anorexia and associated with elevation of CRP and ferritin, but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              Our report suggests that XLA patients might present with high risk to develop pneumonia after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but can recover from infection, suggesting that B-cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease.

pandemic requires extra attention for immunocompromised patients, including solid organ transplant recipients. We report on a case of a  renal transplant recipient in 30s who suffered from a severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical course was complicated by extreme overexposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following coadministration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options. However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy. With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Netherlands","country_treated":"Netherlands","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"This case demonstrates important clinical and pharmacokinetic aspects that play a role in renal transplant recipients with COVID‐19.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"The patient was a renal transplant pt who since transplantation, has been receiving dual maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with everolimus (3 mg BID) and prednisolone (7.5 mg QD), with a stable serum creatinine of around 1.8 mg/dL, an estimated glomerular filtration rate  of 49 mL/min/1.73m2 without albuminuria. After testing positive for Covid-oxygen was given by nasal cannula and IV cefuroxime was started. Directly after assessing his QTc time, oral chloroquine (300 mg BID after 600 mg loading dose) and combination antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg BID) were initiated.Considering interactions with lopinavir/ritonavir, the everolimus dose was reduced from 3 to 2 mg BID. Cefuroxime was replaced by ceftriaxone as part of selective colonic decontamination, which is standard Dutch ICU protocol for intubated patients with expected duration of >24 hours or admission >48 hours. Pt was discharged to the inpatient clinic, but his renal function and respiratory status deteriorated so he was transferred to the transplant center. Lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine, which he had for 4 days, were ceased; antibiotics were continued; and loop diuretics were initiated. Differential diagnoses of the novel respiratory deterioration included pulmonary interstitial diseases associated with everolimus toxicity, pneumonitis, and bacterial or opportunistic superinfection acquired in‐hospital in combination with acute pulmonary edema.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6675,6772,8783]},{"id":5951,"regimens":[{"id":11314,"duration":{"id":5369,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7803,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11314},{"id":8354,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11314}],"created":"2020-09-21T15:52:27.315049Z","updated":"2020-09-27T18:16:42.018954Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5951},{"id":11315,"duration":{"id":5370,"approximate_duration":"11 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7804,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11315},{"id":8355,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11315}],"created":"2020-09-21T15:52:27.322815Z","updated":"2020-09-27T18:16:42.019796Z","dose":"400mg/100mg","frequency":"BID","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5951},{"id":11316,"duration":{"id":5371,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9077,"name":"Methylprednisolone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9077","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7805,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11316},{"id":8356,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11316}],"created":"2020-09-21T15:52:27.329189Z","updated":"2020-09-27T18:16:42.020680Z","dose":"30mg","frequency":"QD","route":"IV","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5951}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7876,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5951},{"id":7877,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5951},{"id":7878,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5951}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13266,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5951},{"id":13267,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5951},{"id":13268,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5951}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3894,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5951},{"id":3895,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":5951}],"adverse_event_outcome":[{"id":47,"answer":"Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment/Damage","report":5951}],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":285,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-16T20:32:01.935665Z","updated":"2020-09-27T18:16:41.972061Z","title":"Two distinct cases with COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients.

Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID-19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36-year-old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID-19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug-to-drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO-incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course. In addition, antiviral agents should be used cautiously, especially in patients on calcineurin inhibitors.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  clinical research/practice; immunosuppressant; infection and infectious agents - viral; infectious disease; kidney (allograft) function/dysfunction; kidney transplantation/nephrology.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Korea, Republic of","country_treated":"Korea, Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"ESRD with living unrelated donor transplant in April 2016","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Atelectasis","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"On hospital day 2, the fever spiked to 38.5°C, and we decided to discontinue the MMF and to start lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg, bid).

The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties. A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus.          \r\n        Case summary:      \r\n              A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea.

Her blood pressure was well controlled. On January 9, 2020, the patient's son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17. The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out. A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia.

We experienced a case of severe thrombocytopenia with epistaxis and petechiae, while treating a COVID-19 patient with ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. The platelet count decreased to 2,000/mm³ and recovered after discontinuation of the three suspected drugs. In treating a potentially fatal emerging infectious disease, empirical and/or experimental approach would be unavoidable.

Respiratory droplets and contaction with infected patients are the two major transmission routes. However, the value of tear virus nucleic acid is still not clear. We dynamic detected the SARS-CoV-2 in eye sample of one COVID-19 patient with obstruction of common lacrimal ducts.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              Besides the routine examination, nasopharyngeal and eye swab were continuously measured by polymerase chain reaction assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS).

The low level of lymphocyte and the high level IL-6 lasted for almost 4 weeks, then became near normal. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed the existing of SARS-CoV-2, HSV1 and HHV6B virus nucleic acid. The gene detection for drug use guidance showed the genetic locus ABCB1 (3435T>C) rs1045642 belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir-ritonavir would be significantly decreased.

The aim of this study is to describe a group of patients who died with TB (active disease or sequelae) and COVID-19 in two cohorts. Data from 49 consecutive cases in 8 countries (cohort A) and 20 hospitalised patients with TB and COVID-19 (cohort B) were analysed and patients who died were described. Demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB and COVID-19 mortality. Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B. Migrants: (1) were younger than natives; in cohort A the median (IQR) age was 40 (27-49) VS. 66 (46-70) years, whereas in cohort B 37 (27-46) VS. 48 (47-60) years; (2) had a lower mortality rate than natives (1/43, 2.3% versus 7/26, 26.9%; p-value: 0.002); (3) had fewer co-morbidities than natives (23/43, 53.5% versus 5/26-19.2%) natives; p-value: 0.005). The study findings show that: (1) mortality is likely to occur in elderly patients with co-morbidities; (2) TB might not be a major determinant of mortality and (3) migrants had lower mortality, probably because of their younger age and lower number of co-morbidities. However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":8,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"71-80 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Pulmonary tuberculosis, Previous TURP, nephrectomy in 2011 for renal cancer, NHL diagnosed in 2017 and treated with R-CHOP regimen for 6 cycles (last cycle February 2020)","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"TB course at time of COVID-19 diagnosis/microbiology - RE, TB diagnosis on BAL, C+/direct microscopy +; due to hepatotoxicity and prothrombin time prolongation TB drugs were stopped and re-challenge was ongoing.

Other than her routine medications, novaRapid (insulin aspart) 4 units three times a day was added to her regimen.\r\n\r\nOn day 3 of hospitalization, while the patient’s vital signs remained stable and O2 saturation was 94% breathing room air, she started to develop generalized hypotonia in lower extremities. There was bilateral weakness on motor examinations, and deep tendon reflexes were absent. Her cranial nerves were normal, and other neurological examinations were unremarkable. Lumbar puncture was performed by a neurologist, which failed to yield any CSF in two repeated attempts. MRI of the whole spine, nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and electromyographic (EMG) studies were requested. After discussion, the neurologist decided to proceed with the administration of methylprednisolone 250 mg IV for possible virus-related immune reaction provided that her blood sugar and electrolytes were controlled.\r\n\r\nOn day 6, she started having difficulty breathing, and her O2 saturation dropped to 78% as her respiratory status deteriorated gradually.

The aim of this study is to describe a group of patients who died with TB (active disease or sequelae) and COVID-19 in two cohorts. Data from 49 consecutive cases in 8 countries (cohort A) and 20 hospitalised patients with TB and COVID-19 (cohort B) were analysed and patients who died were described. Demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB and COVID-19 mortality. Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B. Migrants: (1) were younger than natives; in cohort A the median (IQR) age was 40 (27-49) VS. 66 (46-70) years, whereas in cohort B 37 (27-46) VS. 48 (47-60) years; (2) had a lower mortality rate than natives (1/43, 2.3% versus 7/26, 26.9%; p-value: 0.002); (3) had fewer co-morbidities than natives (23/43, 53.5% versus 5/26-19.2%) natives; p-value: 0.005). The study findings show that: (1) mortality is likely to occur in elderly patients with co-morbidities; (2) TB might not be a major determinant of mortality and (3) migrants had lower mortality, probably because of their younger age and lower number of co-morbidities. However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Infection control; Migrants; Mortality; Sequelae; TB.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":8,"article_patient_number":"8","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":true,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, renal failure","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"CT/C-X ray: bilateral infiltrates\r\nHRZE, C pending/SS+\r\nHb saturation: 99% with re-breather mask, 15 l/min, non-invasive ventilation performed\r\nBCG: unknown\r\nCOVID-19 accelerated death, although the patients was already very compromised since admission\r\nCOVID-19 acquired at hospital","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"Pulmonary tuberculosis","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342,8783,9780]},{"id":6023,"regimens":[{"id":11334,"duration":{"id":5389,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7839,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11334}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:48:20.772182Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:17:15.192023Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6023}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13452,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6023},{"id":13453,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6023}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3990,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6023}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[],"races":[{"id":291,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:47:35.033290Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:17:15.184543Z","title":"Clinicopathologic and Immunohistochemical Findings from Autopsy of Patient with COVID-19, Japan.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32412897,"doi":"10.3201/eid2609.201353","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32412897/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Adachi T\r\nChong JM\r\nNakajima N\r\nSano M\r\nYamazaki J\r\nMiyamoto I\r\nNishioka H\r\nAkita H\r\nSato Y\r\nKataoka M\r\nKatano H\r\nTobiume M\r\nSekizuka T\r\nItokawa K\r\nKuroda M\r\nSuzuki T","article_author_email":"tksuzuki@nih.go.jp","journal":"Emerging infectious diseases","abstract":"An autopsy of a patient in Japan with coronavirus disease indicated pneumonia lung pathology, manifested as diffuse alveolar damage.

Magnetic resonance imaging was negative, whereas electroencephalography showed generalized theta slowing. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses during the acute stage were negative for SARS-CoV-2, positive for pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia, and showed increased interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α concentrations. Other infectious or autoimmune disorders were excluded. A progressive clinical improvement along with a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid parameters was observed after high-dose steroid treatment, thus arguing for an inflammatory-mediated brain involvement related to COVID-19.

The pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now named SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is highly infectious. As of Apr. 9, 2020, over 80 000 confirmed cases had been reported, with an estimated mortality rate of 4.0% (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Person-to-person transmission and familial clustering have been reported (Chan et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; Phan et al., 2020). However, there is no evidence of fetal intrauterine infection in pregnant women who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their third trimester (Chen et al., 2020). It is unclear whether breastfeeding transmits the virus from previously infected and recovered mothers to their babies. Here we report the clinical course of a pregnant woman with COVID-19. In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to newborns through breastfeeding, we measured viral RNA in the patient's breastmilk samples at different time points after delivery.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":true,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Pregnant woman","drug_treatment_features":"The chest computed tomography images revealed diffuse bilateral lung infiltrates.

Caution was taken during delivery to avoid contact, droplet, and airborne transmissions of the virus. At delivery, RT-PCR tests of maternal serum, urine, stool, cord blood, amniotic fluid, and placenta were negative for SARS-CoV-2. An oropharyngeal swab from the newborn baby was obtained immediately after birth, and the result revealed that the infant was negative for SARS-CoV-2. The baby was then sent to a negative-pressure isolation room in the Children’s Hospital of Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China), and the subsequent tests of oropharyngeal swabs, blood, stool, and urine remained negative for SARS-CoV-2. Beginning on the fourth day of hospitalization, repeated RT-PCR analyses of the mother’s sputum and breastmilk were consistently negative for SARS-CoV-2.

However, the effectiveness of ECMO in patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unknown.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              A 72-year-old woman who was a passenger of a cruise ship tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while in quarantine on board using throat swab. Three days after admission, her condition deteriorated, and she was subsequently intubated. On day 6, VV-ECMO was introduced.

No other personal or family history of mental disorders was reported. Police was called by patient's wife because he was more irritable and restless after being hospitalized for COVID-19. The patient was verbally and physically aggressive and used two swords he had in his house to fend himself off from being arrested.\r\n\r\nPrior to this episode, the patient had been treated in the internal medicine department for 8 days as he had presented a bilateral pneumonia with mild respiratory insufficiency related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. He received treatment with oral lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine during these 8 days. The clinical response was good after the introduction of methylprednisolone at high doses. He did not need supplementary oxygen. The only remarkable finding in blood analysis was hyperglycemia, which was related to corticosteroid treatment. At discharge, 32 mg/day of methylprednisolone were prescribed during 4 more days. At the time the patient came to the emergency department, he was not taking corticoids any longer. Physical examination at the emergency department revealed no pathological findings. He had neither fever nor dyspnea. A brain CT was reported not observing intracranial acute pathology.

The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak. All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N=1051).          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e. 3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4.5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, P-value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population.

Presently, emergency surgery for patients with suspected COVID-19 is burdensome not only for patients but also for healthcare workers. Therefore, we established a surveillance system in the emergency room and established principles for managing patients suspected of COVID-19 who require emergency surgery.          \r\n        Case summary:      \r\n              A 67-year-old man was diagnosed with appendicitis in March 2020. His wife was diagnosed with COVID-19 10 d earlier, and the patient was in close contact with her. The patient tested negative twice on an upper respiratory COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screening test, but chest X-ray and chest computed tomography revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in both upper lobes of the patient's lungs. The same emergency surgery procedure for patients with confirmed COVID-19 was applied to this patient suspected of having the disease to ensure that surgery was not delayed while waiting for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results. A few hours after surgery, the upper respiratory tract specimen taken in the emergency room was negative for COVID-19 but the lower respiratory tract specimen was found to be positive for the disease.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              When COVID-19 is suspected, emergency surgery should be performed as for confirmed COVID-19 without delay.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Appendectomy; Appendicitis; COVID-19; Case report; Emergency room; Infection control.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Korea, Republic of","country_treated":"Korea, Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Abdominal","clinical_syndrome":"RLQ pain","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"Ceftriaxone\r\nMetronidazole","unusual":"No respiratory symptoms, RLQ pain linked to appendicitis, Upper respiratory tract swab PCR negative.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"11days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[7166,8342,8783]},{"id":6105,"regimens":[{"id":11517,"duration":{"id":5572,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8132,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11517},{"id":8445,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11517}],"created":"2020-09-25T10:14:17.312161Z","updated":"2020-09-28T03:40:34.803337Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6105},{"id":11518,"duration":{"id":5573,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8133,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11518},{"id":8446,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11518}],"created":"2020-09-25T10:14:17.320002Z","updated":"2020-09-28T03:40:34.804175Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6105}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8009,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6105}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13632,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6105}],"author_username":"Belinda Nhundu","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4099,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6105}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":348,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-25T10:13:02.870978Z","updated":"2020-09-28T03:40:34.766935Z","title":"Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19: Report of three cases and a review of literature.Case 1","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32381430,"doi":"10.1016/j.jdermsci.2020.04.011","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32381430/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Sachdeva M\r\nGianotti R\r\nShah M\r\nBradanini L\r\nTosi D\r\nVeraldi S\r\nZiv M\r\nLeshem E\r\nDodiuk-Gad RP","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"Journal of dermatological science","abstract":"Background:      \r\n              Various cutaneous manifestations have been observed in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Majority of the studies reported no correlation between COVID-19 severity and skin lesions.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              Infection with COVID-19 may result in dermatological manifestations with various clinical presentations, which may aid in the timely diagnosis of this infection.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19;

Thus far, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. The immune system and inflammation are proposed to play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. Intravenous infusion of MSCs has shown promising results in COVID-19 treatment. Here, we report a case of a severe COVID-19 patient treated with human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (hWJCs) from a healthy donor in Liaocheng People's Hospital, China, from February 24, 2020. The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment. After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition. This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"6 days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"According to the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 [14], the patient was treated with antiviral therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, IFN-α inhalation, and also intravenous injection of levofloxacin, tanreqing capsule, xuebijing, thymosin α1, methylprednisolone, and immunoglobulin. During this time, the patient received antipyretic therapy. More treatments were conducted consisting of electrocardiograph monitoring, potassium chloride sustained-release tablets (oral, 1 g per time, 2 times per day), plasma exchange and regulated intestinal microflora of patient, etc. Finally, the discomfort was released, and the oxygen saturation increased to 98%. On February 13 to 21, the patient’s vital physical signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers and shortness of breath.\r\nOn February 22, the patient took a turn for the worse. Considering the severe organ injury caused by an inflammatory response, hWJC adoptive transfer therapy was proposed under the advice and guidance of the specialist group. The family member and patient agreed to try hWJC adoptive transfer therapy. The therapeutic scheme was then discussed and approved by the ethics committee of the hospital, and consent forms were signed by the family member before the therapy.

pandemic. Currently, there is no available treatment proven to be effective against COVID-19, but multiple medications, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are used off label. We report the case of a 60 some-old woman without any cardiac history who developed right bundle brunch block and critically prolonged corrected electrocardiographic QT interval (QTc 631 ms) after treatment for 3 days with HCQ, which resolved on discontinuation of the medication. This case highlights a significant and potentially life-threatening complication of HCQ use.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Indonesia","country_treated":"Brunei Darussalam","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Hyperlipidemia","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"The patient developed RBBB and critically prolonged QTc (QTc > 500 ms) after 3 days of HCQ at a cumulative dose of 1,400 mg","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"The patient's repeat ECG performed 24 hours after the last dose of HCQ showed normalization of the QTc (433 ms).","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"Overweight","disease":630,"drugs":[5905,8342,8342,8783,8783,8971,8971,9463]},{"id":6245,"regimens":[{"id":11992,"duration":{"id":5990,"approximate_duration":"3 Days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8459,"name":"Interferon","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8459","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9215,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11992},{"id":9216,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11992}],"created":"2020-10-12T15:51:19.433284Z","updated":"2020-10-12T16:05:00.591323Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"Inhalation","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6245},{"id":11993,"duration":{"id":5991,"approximate_duration":"3 Days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9217,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11993},{"id":9218,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11993}],"created":"2020-10-12T15:51:19.440912Z","updated":"2020-10-12T16:05:00.597828Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6245}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8214,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6245},{"id":8215,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6245}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13969,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6245},{"id":13970,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6245},{"id":13971,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6245}],"author_username":"Paige Evans","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4288,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6245}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":423,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-10-12T15:49:56.068946Z","updated":"2020-10-12T16:05:00.583349Z","title":"CT imaging of one extended family cluster of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including adolescent patients and \"silent infection\".

A treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine twice daily was started. The patient received also cefepime and remained in isolation. Seven days later imaging showed a progression of the pulmonary infiltrates. Cefepime was replaced by meropenem. During the following 3 days the fever resolved, and the general conditions of the patient significantly improved. Consequently, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine was stopped.

It is unclear whether solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe complications and how they should be managed, also concerning immunosuppression. This is a report about the course and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients from a single center in Northwestern Italy in the period March-April 2020. Three patients who were treated at our institution are reported in detail, whereas summary data are provided for those managed at peripheral Hospitals. Presentation varied from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, treatment and changes to immunosuppression were adapted to the severity of the disease. Overall mortality was 20%, whereas Covid-related mortality was 10%. Two cases of prolonged (>2 months) viral carriage were observed in two asymptomatic patients who contracted the infection in the early course after transplant.

However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls).          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, \r\nP\r\n=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, \r\nP\r\n<0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased. Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; coronavirus; diagnosis; pandemic; troponin.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":32,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"71-80 years","sex":"","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Fever, cough, hypoxia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"27 days after the start of COVID-19 symptoms, the patient experienced a cryptogenic stroke.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342,8783]},{"id":6402,"regimens":[{"id":12400,"duration":{"id":6399,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9952,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12400},{"id":9953,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":12400}],"created":"2020-10-30T14:21:42.007007Z","updated":"2020-10-30T14:50:50.641484Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6402},{"id":12401,"duration":{"id":6400,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6772,"name":"Chloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6772","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":9954,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12401},{"id":9955,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":12401}],"created":"2020-10-30T14:21:42.015062Z","updated":"2020-10-30T14:50:50.647708Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6402}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8404,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6402}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14358,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6402},{"id":14359,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6402},{"id":14360,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6402}],"author_username":"Reema Charles","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Undetermined","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4509,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6402}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":477,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-10-30T14:20:38.576512Z","updated":"2020-10-30T14:50:50.633325Z","title":"First Successful Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Induced Refractory Cardiogenic Plus Vasoplegic Shock by Combination of Percutaneous Ventricular Assist Device and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Case Report.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32472827,"doi":"10.1097/MAT.0000000000001178","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32472827/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Bemtgen X\r\nKrüger K\r\nSupady A\r\nDuerschmied D\r\nSchibilsky D\r\nBamberg F\r\nBode C\r\nWengenmayer T\r\nStaudacher DL","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)","abstract":"The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is infecting hundreds of thousands of humans around the globe.

ventilation. While increased sputum secretion could cause airway obstruction during mechanical ventilation, there are few reported cases in the literature. We report a case of a 65-year-old man with diabetes and severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, nafamostat, and prone positioning. Initially, mechanical ventilation consisted of a heat moisture exchanger, endotracheal tube aspiration, and subglottic secretion drainage using a closed suction system. However, endotracheal tube impaction by highly viscous sputum occurred during this mechanical ventilation system. Replacing the endotracheal tube, the use of a humidifier instead of a heat moisture exchanger, and prone positioning contributed to the patient being weaned off mechanical ventilation. Although anti-aerosol measures are important for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, attention should be given to potential endotracheal tube impaction during mechanical ventilation.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  coronavirus 2019 (covid-19); coronavirus disease 2019; covid-19 respiratory failure high altitude pulmonary edema high flow nasal cannula acute respiratory distress syndrome; invasive mechanical ventilation; key words corona; sars cov-2; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2); tube impaction.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Continuation of mechanical ventilation proved difficult after endotracheal tube impaction with highly viscous sputum.

The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related to coronavirus involves a cytokine storm with high serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-γ, IL-1 and IL-12, and IL-8. Similarly, in COVID-19, higher plasma levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, interferon-γ inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP1A), and TNF-α have been found in patients admitted to intensive care units, and the cytokine storm syndrome was proportional to the severity of disease. The proinflammatory IL-6 appears as one of the key cytokines leading to the inflammatory storm, which may result in increased alveolar–capillary blood–gas exchange dysfunction. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 seems to have a prominent role in this inflammatory cascade.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"France","country_treated":"France","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"metastatic sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient was recently diagnosed with metastatic sarcomatous clear cell renal cell carcinoma and had been hospitalized for fever, symptomatic bone metastases pain management, and first-line systemic treatment decisions.

pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus have been discovered in Wuhan, China, and such cases have spread nationwide quickly. At present, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic. What are the clinical features of this disease? What is the clinical diagnosis and how should such patients be treated? As a clinician, mastery of the clinical characteristics, basic diagnosis, and treatment methods of COVID-19 are required to provide help to patients.          \r\n        Case summary:      \r\n              A 40-some-old patient with a cough lasting 6 d without obvious cause, as well as fever and fatigue for 1 d, was admitted to Hankou Hospital on January 22, 2020 and transferred to Huoshenshan Hospital on February 4. The main clinical symptoms were dry cough, fatigue, and fever. He was diagnosed with COVID-19. From the 4\r\nth\r\n d of admission, the patient's condition gradually worsened, with increased respiratory rate and body temperature. Peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased progressively. On the 8\r\nth\r\n d of admission, the patient's highest temperature was 40.7 °C, and oxygen saturation was 83% despite high-flow oxygen inhalation. Chest computed tomography results showed that the virus progressed rapidly. The number of lesions significantly increased with expanded scope and increased density. The distribution of lesions advanced from peripheral to central. In addition to nasal catheter oxygen inhalation and symptomatic support, antiviral drugs were used throughout the treatment. On January 22, oseltamivir phosphate capsules were given orally (75 mg, twice daily) for 6 d. On January 24, three tablets of lopinavir and ritonavir were added orally (twice daily). After 6 d, this was changed to 0.2 g (two tablets) arbidol, taken orally (three times daily) for 5 d. During the severe stage, methylprednisolone was given (40 mg) once every 12 h, immunoglobulin (20 g) was administered by intravenous drip infusion once daily, and thymosin (1.6 mg) was injected subcutaneously once daily combined with immunotherapy. On February 2, symptoms decreased, various indicators improved, and pulmonary inflammation was obviously reduced. Throat swabs on February 4 and 9 were negative for novel coronavirus nucleic acid. After 19 d in the hospital, the patient was successfully treated and discharged.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              COVID-19 in young adults can be successfully treated with active treatment. We report a typical case of COVID-19, analyze its clinical characteristics, summarize its clinical diagnosis and treatment experience, and provide a reference for clinical colleagues.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Case report; Clinical characteristics; Diagnosis and treatment; SARS-CoV-2; Young adults.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection, pulmonary lesions, fatigue, fever","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8412,8783,9077,9463,11327,10942]},{"id":6462,"regimens":[{"id":12620,"duration":{"id":6610,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":10444,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":12620},{"id":10445,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":12620},{"id":10446,"answer":"In a novel population (e.g. pediatrics/neonates, pregnant women, immunosuppressed, etc.)","answer_other":"","regimen":12620}],"created":"2020-11-13T22:11:55.874531Z","updated":"2020-11-16T20:55:57.519261Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6462}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8492,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6462},{"id":8493,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6462},{"id":8519,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6462}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":14521,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6462},{"id":14573,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6462}],"author_username":"Cure Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Other Healthcare Professional","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4598,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6462},{"id":4599,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy in this patient population","answer_other":"","report":6462}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":399,"name":"Diarrhea (Infectious)"},{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-11-13T22:11:16.163282Z","updated":"2020-11-16T20:55:57.511359Z","title":"Serial computed tomographic findings and specific clinical features of pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia: A case report.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32548166,"doi":"10.12998/wjcc.v8.i11.2345","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32548166/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Chen X\r\nZou XJ\r\nXu Z","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"World journal of clinical cases","abstract":"A series of recent cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV, also called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2].

In this pandemic period, the chance of incidental pulmonary findings suggestive of COVID-19 at F-FDG PET/CT in asymptomatic oncological patients is not negligible. To suspect COVID-19 is more demanding whether its presentation is atypical. We describe the incidental PET/CT detection of an F-FDG-avid isolated centrilobular pulmonary consolidation in an asymptomatic lymphoma patient, which later resulted in an unexpected and atypical COVID-19 presentation.

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo. En todos los casos la radiografía de tórax era patológica con infiltrado unilateral o bilateral. La procalcitonina demostró no ser suficientemente sensible para detectar la infección neumocócica. La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida. Los clínicos deben de ser conscientes de la posible asociación de SARS-CoV-2 y neumococo para evitar errores diagnósticos y retrasos en el tratamiento antibiótico.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Coinfección; Diagnosis; Diagnóstico; S. pneumoniae; Tratamiento; Treatment; co-infection.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"Yes","age":"81-89 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Ischemic Heart Disease\r\nAortic Stenosis","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including diabetes, hypertension (treated with ARBs), Ischemic heart disease, aortic stenosis, and chronic kidney disease.

Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo. En todos los casos la radiografía de tórax era patológica con infiltrado unilateral o bilateral. La procalcitonina demostró no ser suficientemente sensible para detectar la infección neumocócica. La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida. Los clínicos deben de ser conscientes de la posible asociación de SARS-CoV-2 y neumococo para evitar errores diagnósticos y retrasos en el tratamiento antibiótico.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Coinfección; Diagnosis; Diagnóstico; S. pneumoniae; Tratamiento; Treatment; co-infection.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"5","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"asthma, obesity","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including diabetes, obesity, and asthma.

disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered to be spread primarily by people who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we discuss a patient with severe COVID-19 and a history of type 2 diabetes who had a recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) after recovering. The patient was initially discharged after two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and partially absorbed bilateral lesions on chest computed tomography (CT). However, at his first follow-up, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay with an oropharyngeal swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Despite this, he displayed no obvious clinical symptoms and improved chest CT. The patient was prescribed anti-viral medication. Eight consecutive RT-PCR assays on oropharyngeal swab specimens were conducted after he was re-admitted to our hospital. The results tested positive on the 12th, 14th, 19th, 23rd and 26th of March and negative on the 28th of March, and 6th and 12th of April. After his second discharge, he has tested negative for 5 weeks. This case highlights the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the follow-up period so that an infectivity assessment can be made.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronavirus disease 2019; Recurrence; SARS-CoV-2; Severe; Type 2 diabetes.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"5 weeks","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a history of diabetes.

We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n

Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronovirus; Intestine; Microbe; Yeast.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":30,"article_patient_number":"11","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Hong Kong","country_treated":"Hong Kong","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":true,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"hyperlipidemia, left subclavian artery occlusion","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, fever, cough, sputum, dyspnea","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and left subclavian artery occlusion.

Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls.

Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronovirus; Intestine; Microbe; Yeast.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":30,"article_patient_number":"27","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"Unknown","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Egypt","country_treated":"Hong Kong","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":true,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Cervical radiculopathy, bilateral varicose vein with bilateral Trendelenburg operation","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, fever","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including cervical radiculopathy and bilateral varicose vein with Trendelenburg operation.

\r\n            COVID-19 is a respiratory illness due to novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), described in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and rapidly evolved into a pandemic. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract can also be involved.    \r\n          Case presentation:        \r\n            A 44-year-old man was hospitalised for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A rapid recovery of respiratory and general symptoms was observed after 1 week of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine and broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam plus teicoplanin). No GI symptoms were reported during hospitalisation, but a lung contrast-enhancement CT (CE-CT) excluding thromboembolism showed, as collateral finding, intraperitoneal free bubbles not present on a previous CT examination; the subsequent abdominal CE-CT described pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) involving the caecum and the right colon. Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was started, and the 2-week follow-up CT showed the complete resolution of PI.    \r\n          Discussion:        \r\n            The pathogenesis of PI is poorly understood. PI involving the caecum and right colon has been described for HIV and Cytomegalovirus infections, but, to our best knowledge, never before in COVID-19. We hypothesise a multifactorial aetiopathogenesis for PI, with a possible role of the bowel wall damage and microbiota impairment due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we suggest a conservative management in the absence of symptoms.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            bacterial overgrowth;

Data on treatment are scare and parallels have been made between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral with efficient in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir is controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement. This case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit treatment for respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, highlights the complexity of remdesivir use in such critically ill patients.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            Antiviral therapy; Case reports; Remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2 viral load; Viral pneumonia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"France","country_treated":"France","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"COPD","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"Remdesivir was started on day 11 of illness and discontinued 2 days later because of acute kidney injury (creatinine level up to 396 μmol/l) needing renal replacement therapy.","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient developed multiple organ failure and refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome despite prone positioning and adapted mechanical ventilation.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used controller medications in patients with asthma. It is unclear whether ICS use increases the risk for severe COVID-19 infection. At the current time, asthma organizations are still recommending the continued use of ICS and other asthma medications to minimize the risk of uncontrolled asthma. However, for patients with asthma and who have recovered from COVID-19 infection, the timing of resumption of asthma therapy is equally uncertain. Pulmonary function testing and exhaled oral nitric oxide testing are aerosol-generating procedures and are currently being severely restricted at most health-care facilities. We presented a case of a patient with cough-variant asthma who developed severe COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome with the need for intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation. We highlighted the potential utility of using COVID-19 RNA detection as well as immunoglobulin G antibody testing to help guide the timing of resumption of asthma therapy.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":true,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"The patient traveled to Madrid, Spain, and 5 days later on return, he developed fever, myalgia, and cough.

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

Severe COVID‐19 patients present with increased inflammatory markers, akin to secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), that have been shown to predict mortality. There is emerging evidence for the use of an interleukin 6 (IL‐6) inhibitor, tocilizumab (TCZ), for suppression of the inflammatory cytokine storm in this context. Ruxolitinib (RXB), a JAK‐STAT inhibitor, has also been shown to have proven efficacy in the treatment of sHLH.

Social distancing measures were needed to reduce transmission, and lockdown included restricted access to health care facilities. The impact of COVID-19 on transplant recipients is unknown, but considering their immunosuppression status and associated comorbidities, they should be considered a high-risk population.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            A kidney transplant center in Central Italy implemented a strategy to maintain follow-up of kidney transplant recipients by phone and e-mail during lockdown. Telephone interviews were used to administer a clinical questionnaire to patients, and e-mail was used to receive the results of diagnostic tests conducted in outpatient settings.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            From March 17 to April 23, 2020, a total of 143 kidney transplant recipients were contacted.

Eleven patients were managed at home for mild urinary or respiratory diseases, and 1 was referred to the hematologist. We identified 2 suspected cases of COVID-19 infection, and the patients were referred to hospital care.

Real-time RT-PCR assays are recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19. Here we report a rare case of COVID-19 with multiple negative results for PCR assays outside Wuhan, China.    \r\n          Case presentation:        \r\n            A 32-year old male was admitted to our hospital because of 6 days of unexplained fever on January 29, 2020. He had come from Wuhan city 10 days before admission. Five days before admission, no abnormality was noted in laboratory test, chest radiography, and nasopharyngeal swab test for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The patient was treated with ibuprofen for alleviating fever. On admission, chest computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacities in right lower lung field. COVID-19 was suspected. Three times of nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected after admission. However, none of the specimens were positive. The patient was confirmed with COVID-19 after fifth SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. He was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, recombinant human interferon alfa-2b inhalation, methylprednisolone. After 18 days of treatment, he was discharged with improved symptoms, lung lesions and negative results of nasopharyngeal swab.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            This case reminds clinician that a patient with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but multiple negative RT-PCR result should not be taken out of isolation.
