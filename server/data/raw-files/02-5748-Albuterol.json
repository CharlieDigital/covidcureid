Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm. Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions. We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19.          \r\n        Materials and methods:      \r\n              Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              Preliminary observations and a strong scientific foundation suggest that nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; cytokine storm; neuromodulation; non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation; respiratory symptoms.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"seasonal allergies, sleep apnea, and hypercholesterolemia and ongoing use of a continuous positive airway pressure device for sleep apnea for 15 years","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Ongoing medications at hospital admission included ramipril (10 mg/d, for hypertension), metformin (2000 mg/d, for diabetes), glipizide (10 mg/d, for diabetes), and atorvastatin (40 mg/d for hypercholesterolemia). \r\n\r\nHe was provided supplemental oxygen (2 L via nasal cannula) but reported that he repeatedly stopped using it, owing to nasal dryness and epistaxis. His oxygen saturation was monitored (lowest recorded measurement, 93%). \r\n\r\nHe received oral oxycodone (5 mg)/acetaminophen (325 mg) every four hours for pain. \r\n\r\nFor cough, he initially received dextromethorphan/guaifenesin/acetaminophen every four hours, which was subsequently replaced with hydrocodone bitartrate/homatropine methyl bromide (5 mL every six hours).\r\n\r\nThe patient, a clinician who had familiarity with neuromodulation through his practice, began using nVNS to treat his respiratory symptoms and expedite recovery at home. His typical treatment regimen consisted of two consecutive 120‐second periods of stimulation (one on each side of the neck) administered approximately every three hours while awake. He reported using additional nVNS treatment (two stimulation episodes) as needed, approximately once per day.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5748,6122,8342]},{"id":6616,"regimens":[{"id":13184,"duration":{"id":7074,"approximate_duration":"5
