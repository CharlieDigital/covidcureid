The patient was diagnosed with tonsillitis and treated with Aztreonam. Five days later, patient symptoms improved, and she maintained normal body temperature. The patient's oropharyngeal swab test for COVID became negative.\r\n\r\nAfter admission, the patient received antiviral treatment, including lopinavir (Kaletra®, 400 mg, q12h, po),  Arbidol (Manuosu®, 0.2  g, tid, po) and Lianhua Qingwen capsule (Chinese medicine, 6g, tid, po) and recombinant human interferon (5 million iu Bid nebulization).

The chest CT on that same day showed multiple patchy ground-glass opacities in the upper and lower lobes of both lungs.\r\n\r\nOn day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Oseltamivir  (kewei®75mg, bid, po) and Yinlianjiedutang (Chinese medicine) were added to her antiviral  treatment.  On hospital day 16, the patient’s symptoms improved and supplemental oxygen was discontinued.

We herein report four COVID-19 cases with long-term positive viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) for about 61 days. Despite treatment with recombinant human interferon, convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients, arbidol, etc., nucleic acid results were still positive for SARS-CoV-2. After treatment with ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (DNVr, 100/100 mg, once daily), all four patients showed two to three consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA and were thus discharged from hospital. Therefore, DNVr may be a potentially effective antiviral for COVID-19 patients with long-term positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":4,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":true,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"The duration from positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA to two consecutive negative results was 66 days.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[11385,8783,11423,11423,10942]}]
