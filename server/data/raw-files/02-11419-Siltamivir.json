A man diagnosed with COVID-19 was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. The patient's O2 saturation was 80% using an oxygen mask, which was gradually declining. After 4 sessions of HP/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT), O2 saturation reached to 95%, and the patient was transferred to the general ward. Performing HP/CRRT at the early stages of ARDS can obviate the need for intubating patients with COVID-19. Punctual and early use of HP and CRRT in the treatment of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 prevented the progression of ARDS and patient intubation, reduced respiratory distress and the patient's dependence on oxygen, prevented other complications such as AKI and septic shock in the patient, and reduced mortality and hospital length of stay.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infections","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"This report suggests that application of CRRT/HP in the early stages of ARDS, when the O2 saturation of the patient's blood with a reservoir oxygen mask is <90%, prevented the progression of the disease to moderate-to-severe ARDS, stabilized the O2 saturation, and gradually led to increased O2 saturation, prevention of intubation, improved clinical conditions, reduced dependence on oxygen, discharge from ICUs, and ultimately discharge from the hospital.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Performing HP/CRRT at the early stages of ARDS can obviate the need for intubating patients with COVID-19.
