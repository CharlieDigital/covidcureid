Outcomes and results were extracted from medical records.\nResults\nMean age was 69.5Â±14.9 years. 20/23 had significant co-morbidities. At baseline, 22/23 were receiving supplemental oxygen (3/23 high flow, 7/23 mechanical ventilation). Blood showed markedly elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein) and elevated neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. By day 30 after initial dosing, 17/23 were recovered, 2/23 were still hospitalized, and 4/23 had died. Of the 7 intubated at baseline, 4/7 were fully recovered off oxygen, 2/7 were still hospitalized, and 1/7 had died.\nConclusions\nLeronlimab appeared safe and well tolerated. The high recovery rate suggested benefit, and those with lower inflammatory markers had better outcomes. Some but not all patients appeared to have dramatic clinical responses, indicating that unknown factors may determine responsiveness to leronlimab. Routine inflammatory and cell prognostic markers did not markedly change immediately after treatment, although IL-6 tended to fall. In some persons C-reactive protein clearly dropped only after the second leronlimab dose, suggesting that a higher loading dose might be more effective. Future controlled trials will be informative.","datetime":"2020-10-29T11:33:31.514486Z","anonymous":false,"deleted":false,"flagged":false,"report":6390},{"id":419,"author_username":"Raghav Tirupathi","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":null,"author_country":"","created":"2020-10-29T11:35:08.145628Z","updated":"2020-10-29T11:35:08.145656Z","body":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1583","datetime":"2020-10-29T11:35:08.145696Z","anonymous":false,"deleted":false,"flagged":false,"report":6390},{"id":420,"author_username":"Raghav Tirupathi","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":null,"author_country":"","created":"2020-10-29T11:36:52.912035Z","updated":"2020-10-29T11:36:52.912064Z","body":"thank you for documenting this case report in cure. leronlimab is now being looked into with enthusiasm across the globe and a recent case series in CID documents improvement in majority of patients. can you shed more details if this elderly pt was intubated ?","datetime":"2020-10-29T11:36:52.912103Z","anonymous":false,"deleted":false,"flagged":false,"report":6390}],"article_language":"","why_new_way":[{"id":4489,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6390}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[],"races":[{"id":473,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-10-28T22:58:06.777127Z","updated":"2020-10-28T23:02:42.766128Z","title":null,"status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":false,"pubmed_id":null,"doi":"","article_url":null,"pub_year":null,"published_authors":"","article_author_email":"","journal":"","abstract":"","article_type":"","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":null,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":false,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"81-89 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":true,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"ckd","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"hypoxemic respiratory failure","severity":null,"prev_treatment":null,"unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"28 days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[11405]}]
