On January 17, 2020, the patient presented a feeling of general malaise and coldness. On January 19, she had fever with body temperature of 37.3 °C and experienced diarrhea and vomiting. She started to receive intravenous injection of cefotaxime in community clinic and took oral Jinyebaidu granules (another Chinese traditional patent medicine) and oseltamivir\r\n(75 mg, twice a day) for 4 days. She had persistent severe fever with body temperature from 37.6 °C to\r\n38.3 °C for four days. On January 23, her chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple patchy ground glass opacity and consolidation shadow in bilateral lung and sub-pleural regions.  She was highly suspected with COVID-19.  Oral moxifloxacin and arbidol were prescribed, and she continued to take Jinyebaidu granules and oseltamivir. On January 24, her body temperature reached 39.9 °C and experienced severe fatigue, diarrhea, and breathlessness despite continuous treatments of the above drugs. She felt better after intravenous injection of immunoglobin (IVIG, 5 g per day) and dexamethasone (5 mg, once to twice a day). However, the patient experienced recurrent fever (body temperature of 39 °C) and breathlessness, and her blood oxygen saturation fluctuated from 90% to 95% at the night of January 27. On January 28, the second chest CT scan indicated that her pneumonia aggravated for the past 5 days (Fig. 1B). A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was obtained and sent for detection of 2019-nCoV. Although the patient’s 2019-nCoV test was negative (Table 1), she was diagnosed of COVID-19 in accordance with her symptoms and chest CT display. On the same day, she was confined into an isolation ward and started to take oral SHL (twice a day, 20 mL once). On the next day, SHL administration increased to three times a day (20 mL once) without using any other drugs. From January 29 to 31, the patient’s symptoms resolved with body temperature decreasing from 37.3 °C to 36.5 °C and without vomiting and diarrhea. The patient gradually felt strong except for slight cough. After February 6, the patient’s symptoms disappeared, and her third chest CT scan (Fig. 1C) showed significant absorption of bilateral ground glass opacity compared with the previous ones.\r\n\r\nEver on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: No","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[7230,8412,9197,11307,10942]},{"id":5775,"regimens":[{"id":10719,"duration":{"id":4775,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6820,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10719},{"id":6821,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10719}],"created":"2020-09-03T19:54:50.651986Z","updated":"2020-09-03T20:03:34.371419Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"Patient required NIV","comments":null,"report":5775},{"id":10720,"duration":{"id":4776,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6822,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10720},{"id":6823,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10720}],"created":"2020-09-03T19:54:50.660143Z","updated":"2020-09-03T20:03:34.378802Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5775},{"id":10721,"duration":{"id":4777,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":7230,"name":"Dexamethasone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/7230","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6824,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10721},{"id":6825,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10721}],"created":"2020-09-03T19:54:50.667387Z","updated":"2020-09-03T20:03:34.385590Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5775}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7529,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5775},{"id":7530,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5775}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":12780,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5775},{"id":12781,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5775},{"id":12782,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5775}],"author_username":"Parvesh Paul","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.","author_country":"India","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3679,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5775},{"id":3680,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":5775}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":107,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-03T19:51:14.729882Z","updated":"2020-09-03T20:03:34.362039Z","title":"A single center observational study of the clinical characteristics and short-term outcome of 20 kidney transplant patients admitted for SARS-CoV2 pneumonia.

We describe 20 kidney transplant recipients (median age 59 years [inter quartile range 51-64 years], median age of transplant 13 years [9-20 years], baseline eGFR 36.5 [23-47.5]) with SARS-CoV2 induced pneumonia. At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function. At baseline, all patients presented fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing. Half of patients showed chest radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates while the other half showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates. During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy. Six patients developed acute kidney injury with one requiring hemodialysis. Six of 12 patients were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor. Overall, five kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days [15-19] from symptom onset. These preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. Thus, in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients, SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by high risk of progression and significant mortality.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":20,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Post renal transplant in 2004","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Patient required NIV and had also developed ARDS","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[7230,8342,8783,10776]},{"id":5938,"regimens":[{"id":11117,"duration":{"id":5176,"approximate_duration":"3 doses","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":7230,"name":"Dexamethasone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/7230","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7475,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11117}],"created":"2020-09-16T16:06:55.312087Z","updated":"2020-09-27T19:39:16.336059Z","dose":"4mg","frequency":"Q12H","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5938}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7775,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5938},{"id":7776,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5938},{"id":7777,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5938}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13236,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5938},{"id":13237,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5938}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3880,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5938}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":230,"answer":"Asian","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-16T16:06:34.788782Z","updated":"2020-09-27T19:39:16.328165Z","title":"Lopinavir/ritonavir did not shorten the duration of SARS CoV-2 shedding in patients with mild pneumonia in Taiwan.

The aim of this study is to describe a group of patients who died with TB (active disease or sequelae) and COVID-19 in two cohorts. Data from 49 consecutive cases in 8 countries (cohort A) and 20 hospitalised patients with TB and COVID-19 (cohort B) were analysed and patients who died were described. Demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB and COVID-19 mortality. Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B. Migrants: (1) were younger than natives; in cohort A the median (IQR) age was 40 (27-49) VS. 66 (46-70) years, whereas in cohort B 37 (27-46) VS. 48 (47-60) years; (2) had a lower mortality rate than natives (1/43, 2.3% versus 7/26, 26.9%; p-value: 0.002); (3) had fewer co-morbidities than natives (23/43, 53.5% versus 5/26-19.2%) natives; p-value: 0.005). The study findings show that: (1) mortality is likely to occur in elderly patients with co-morbidities; (2) TB might not be a major determinant of mortality and (3) migrants had lower mortality, probably because of their younger age and lower number of co-morbidities. However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":8,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"71-80 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Pulmonary tuberculosis, Previous TURP, nephrectomy in 2011 for renal cancer, NHL diagnosed in 2017 and treated with R-CHOP regimen for 6 cycles (last cycle February 2020)","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"TB course at time of COVID-19 diagnosis/microbiology - RE, TB diagnosis on BAL, C+/direct microscopy +; due to hepatotoxicity and prothrombin time prolongation TB drugs were stopped and re-challenge was ongoing.

Our 2 patients with a confirmed influenza SARS‐CoV‐2virus infection had respiratory distress with lung crackles on auscultation of one or both lungs and with alveolar pulmonary edema on the chest CT‐Scan. The cardiogenic nature of pulmonary edema was ruled out in both cases by a transthoracic echocardiography showing normal systolic and diastolic functions. Our patients were treated by oxygen via face mask in one case and mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment in the other patient. Hydroxychloroquine (600mg/day), Azithromycine, steroids (dexamethasone 20mg/day), vitamin C (3g/day), Zinc, diuretics and Enoxaparine were equally used for the two patients. Evolution was marked by a good outcome in both of them. In summary, acute respiratory failure is a rare but major complication of COVID‐19 virus infection. It is due to pulmonary capillary leak syndrome. Treatment is based on a good oxygenation, intravenous corticosteroids, diuretics, Azithromycine, vitamin C, and other symptomatic treatments.

Data on treatment are scare and parallels have been made between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral with efficient in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir is controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement. This case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit treatment for respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, highlights the complexity of remdesivir use in such critically ill patients.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            Antiviral therapy; Case reports; Remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2 viral load; Viral pneumonia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"France","country_treated":"France","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"COPD","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"Remdesivir was started on day 11 of illness and discontinued 2 days later because of acute kidney injury (creatinine level up to 396 μmol/l) needing renal replacement therapy.","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient developed multiple organ failure and refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome despite prone positioning and adapted mechanical ventilation.

At present, an effective treatment regimen and vaccination has not been established. Many patients develop severe symptoms requiring endotracheal intubation and a prolonged stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In early postmortem examinations of COVID-19 patients, profuse viscous secretions were observed throughout the respiratory tract. Thus, oxygen supplementation without aggressive pulmonary hygiene management may be suboptimal. In the present case series, pulmonary hygiene management encompassed mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning.

At present, an effective treatment regimen and vaccination has not been established. Many patients develop severe symptoms requiring endotracheal intubation and a prolonged stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In early postmortem examinations of COVID-19 patients, profuse viscous secretions were observed throughout the respiratory tract. Thus, oxygen supplementation without aggressive pulmonary hygiene management may be suboptimal. In the present case series, pulmonary hygiene management encompassed mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning. We report 3 severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in cruise ship employees who were admitted to the ICU and responded to supportive mechanical ventilation and pulmonary hygiene management. \r\n\r\nCASE REPORT Three cruise ship employees with COVID-19 underwent endotracheal intubation and were admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Initial chest X-rays suggested multifocal pneumonia with superimposed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A regimen of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and dexamethasone was initiated on admission in all cases. Additionally, medications used for pulmonary hygiene were administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in line with the ventilator circuit. Endotracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration. The duration from endotracheal intubation to extubation ranged from 9 to 24 days. All 3 patients reached 30-day survival. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS The cases reported highlight the importance of the use of airway hygiene with mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilatory support.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"3","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, anxious, restless, dyspneic","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Tracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration.\r\n\r\nThroughout the remainder of the hospital course, the patient remained on nasal cannula with SpO2 ranging between 98–93%.

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.
