Laboratory examinations showed normal leukocyte (4170/μL), neutrophils (59.6%), and lymphocytes (30.9%). There was an increase in hematocrit (0.456) and glucose (7.3 mmol/L) levels. The initial chest radiograph, taken 3-days\r\nafter fever onset, was normal in both lungs (Fig. 1A).

She was given antibiotics for symptomatic treatment.\r\n\r\nAt first, the patient did not show any respiratory symptoms, however, on day 6 after fever onset, she began coughing. A follow-up chest CT revealed an increased density of GGOs in the right lower lobe, which then progressed into consolidations with perilobular thickening.

Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3-38.0 ℃). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge.

Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3-38.0 ℃). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3-14, 6-8 and 7-9 days, respectively.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: \r\nIncreasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement.

In addition, he required vasopressor support with noradrenaline. His clinical conditions progressively improved and, after discontinuing antibiotics on March 3 and invasive mechanical ventilation on March 4, the patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit on March 5.\r\n\r\nOn March 8, after 2 days of diarrhea, the patient complained of abdominal pain and marked distension; at clinical examination, signs of peritoneal irritation were detected. A plain X-ray film and a CT scan showed massive free air in the abdominal cavity, distension of the large bowel, and perforation of the ascending colon. In addition, pulmonary embolism was detected. The patient underwent emergent laparotomy: intraoperative findings included profuse amount of free air, distension of the entire abdominal colon, and a minimal perforation on the anterolateral aspect of the distended cecum. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular weight heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and fluconazole were started immediately after surgery.  chest X-ray showed resolution of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Lopinavir/ritonavir was discontinued on March 11, while hydroxychloroquine and anakinra were maintained until March 18.\r\n\r\nThe patient was discharged on postoperative day 18 (March 26). The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal on March 23 tested positive, and the patient was encouraged to maintain home quarantine for at least 14 days.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5926,8342,8711,8745,8782,11370]},{"id":6150,"regimens":[{"id":11658,"duration":{"id":5702,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8539,"answer":"To
