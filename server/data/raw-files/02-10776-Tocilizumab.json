During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy.

pathology","abstract":"Despite the current pandemic season, reports on pathologic features of coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) are exceedingly rare at the present time. Here we describe the pathologic features of early lung involvement by Covid-19 in a surgical sample resected for carcinoma from a patient who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after surgery. The main histologic findings observed were pneumocyte damage, alveolar hemorrhages with clustering of macrophages, prominent and diffuse neutrophilic margination within septal vessels, and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, mainly represented by CD8+ T lymphocytes.

They had a positive PCR confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection on hospital day 2 and were started on Hydroxychloroquine. HCQ was continued through hospital day 5 and then was stopped. Due to worsening oxygen requirements and increased inflammatory markers and infiltrates on CXR, Tocilizumab was administered on hospital day 7. Improvement was seen for 2 days, followed by worsening oxygen requirements and inflammatory markers, and a second dose of Tocilizumab was administered on hospital day 11. Patient improved and was discharged from hospital on day 17. \r\n\r\nThe patient is a 65-year-old Hispanic female with history of end stage renal disease secondary to long\r\nstanding diabetes and hypertension who received a deceased donor renal transplant four years prior. She had uneventful post-transplant course with a baseline serum creatinine (SCr) of 1.2 mg/dL and maintained on triple immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone. She presented to the hospital with a 1-week history of worsening cough and shortness of breath. Upon presentation, patient was hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Her examination was significant for crackles in both lung fields. \r\n\r\nLaboratory findings revealed WBC 4.9 k/mm3 with lymphopenia (0.6 k/mm3), procalcitonin 0.17 ng/mL,\r\ntroponin-I <0.040 ng/mL, BNP 68 pg/mL, SCr 1.3 mg/dL, AST 39 units/L and tacrolimus trough level 7.0 ng/mL. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral reticulonodular pulmonary opacities. Supplemental oxygen of 2 L/min by nasal cannula and an empiric antibiotic regimen of ceftriaxone and azithromycin were initiated. A nasal swab multiplex viral PCR panel and blood cultures were negative. \r\n\r\nOn hospital day 2, upon the COVID-19 nasal swab PCR resulting positive, hydroxychloroquine was initiated. Mycophenolate was discontinued and dosing of tacrolimus was lowered to target trough levels of 3-5 ng/mL. Despite remaining afebrile and normotensive throughout hospitalization, she had progressively increasing oxygen requirements. Inflammatory markers collected on hospital day 5 including CRP and ferritin were noted to be significantly elevated at 16.4 mg/dL and 2671 ng/mL respectively. Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg daily was then initiated but no improvement was noted. She also developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with SCr of 1.7 mg/dL and mild transaminitis (AST 73 units/L, ALT 47 units/L). With increasing oxygen requirement to 15 L/min, worsening of inflammatory markers and CXR infiltrates, tocilizumab 400 mg (5 mg/kg) was administered on hospital day 7.\r\n\r\nAn IL-6 level obtained prior to tocilizumab administration was 241 pg/mL. Subsequently by hospital day 9,\r\noxygen requirements improved to 6 L/min along with improvements in inflammatory markers and CXR\r\ninfiltrates. On hospital day 11, patient again had increasing oxygen requirements to 11 L/min with up trending LDH and worsening CXR infiltrates. Given this, a second dose of tocilizumab 400 mg was administered. \r\n\r\nFollowing this dose, patient had progressive improvement in hypoxia, inflammatory markers, as well as\r\ninfiltrates on CXR.

After administration of SC tocilizumab, fever disappeared, and lung function progressively improved, with reduction of oxygen support and positioning of nasal oxygen flow with 4 l/min.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342,9780,10776]},{"id":6035,"regimens":[{"id":11355,"duration":{"id":5410,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7870,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11355},{"id":8419,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11355}],"created":"2020-09-22T15:33:56.583469Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:53:44.479637Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6035},{"id":11356,"duration":{"id":5411,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7871,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11356},{"id":8420,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11356}],"created":"2020-09-22T15:33:56.591701Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:53:44.480466Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6035},{"id":11357,"duration":{"id":5412,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":10776,"name":"Tocilizumab","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10776","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7872,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11357},{"id":8421,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11357}],"created":"2020-09-22T15:33:56.598035Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:53:44.481249Z","dose":null,"frequency":"Once","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6035}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7904,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6035},{"id":7905,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6035}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13482,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6035},{"id":13483,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6035},{"id":13484,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6035}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4008,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6035}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-09-22T15:33:11.157369Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:53:44.435626Z","title":"Abnormalities on chest computed tomography in patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

Case reports and case series depicting the clinical effects of the causative virus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-have been published, yet few demonstrate the cytopathologic alterations of this disease. We present a clinical-pathologic correlation report of a previously healthy Hispanic woman with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had typical features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and also showed cardiac abnormalities thought to represent fulminant viral myocarditis. Congruent with the ARDS clinical impression, autopsy findings were remarkable for extensive and markedly severe acute lung injury consistent with viral pneumonia, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary infarction, severe pulmonary edema, desquamation of pneumocytes with intra-alveolar aggregation, and pneumocyte morphologic alterations suggestive of viral cytopathic effect. However, there was incongruence between the clinical impression and the cardiovascular pathology findings in that viral myocarditis was not detected on histopathologic evaluation. This case highlights the importance of pathologic corroboration of the clinical impression and, in addition, illuminates the key role autopsy plays during a pandemic by providing valuable insight into viral pathology in tissues.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Developed severe multiorgan failure and died.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342,10776]},{"id":6037,"regimens":[{"id":11361,"duration":{"id":5416,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7873,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11361},{"id":8412,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11361}],"created":"2020-09-22T15:41:54.548091Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:49:25.406106Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6037},{"id":11362,"duration":{"id":5417,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7874,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11362},{"id":8413,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11362}],"created":"2020-09-22T15:41:54.555606Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:49:25.406984Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6037},{"id":11363,"duration":{"id":5418,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":10776,"name":"Tocilizumab","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10776","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7875,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11363},{"id":8414,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11363}],"created":"2020-09-22T15:41:54.562623Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:49:25.407803Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":6037}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7906,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6037},{"id":7907,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6037}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13487,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6037},{"id":13488,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6037}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4010,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6037}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-09-22T15:41:23.931430Z","updated":"2020-09-27T23:49:25.359254Z","title":"Abnormalities on chest computed tomography in patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

On 08 March 2020 the clinical condition of the patient deteriorated, and he exhibited dyspnea with an oxygen saturation of 85%. Fever and cough were persistent, and new chest X-ray imaging revealed progression of bilateral infiltration in the lower and upper lobes. It was decided to initiate ribavirin 1,200 mg p.o. b.i.d. and immunoglobulin 20 mg i.v. daily. Meropenem and teicoplanin were also started to cover any probable bacterial sources. After 2 days, on 10 March 2020, his clinical condition worsened. Dyspnea continued with greater severity and he had an oxygen saturation of 83%.the patient was a candidate for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, this did not happen.

After 2 days, the patient's dyspnea had gradually improved and his oxygen saturation increased to 90%.Recovery was observed over the next few days, and dyspnea and oxygen saturation significantly improved.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8342,8412,8466,8783,9463,10130,10776]},{"id":6165,"regimens":[{"id":11729,"duration":{"id":5742,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":10776,"name":"Tocilizumab","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10776","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8679,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11729},{"id":8680,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11729}],"created":"2020-09-30T21:58:22.061599Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:37:35.667499Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6165},{"id":11730,"duration":{"id":687,"approximate_duration":"4 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8681,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11730},{"id":8682,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11730}],"created":"2020-09-30T21:58:22.069494Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:37:35.675046Z","dose":"500mg","frequency":"LD","route":"oral","severity":"Outpatient","severity_detail":"switched to 250mg QD day 2-4","comments":null,"report":6165},{"id":11731,"duration":{"id":111,"approximate_duration":"4 Days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8856,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11731},{"id":8857,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11731}],"created":"2020-09-30T22:50:34.123745Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:37:35.704818Z","dose":"800mg","frequency":"LD","route":"oral","severity":"Outpatient","severity_detail":"switch to 400mg QD day 2-4","comments":null,"report":6165}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":8089,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6165},{"id":8090,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6165}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13777,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6165}],"author_username":"Belinda Nhundu","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":4173,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6165}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-09-30T21:43:00.830596Z","updated":"2020-10-05T03:37:35.659568Z","title":"Remdesivir and tocilizumab: Mix or match.Case 1","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32492200,"doi":"10.1002/jmv.26117","article_url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32492200/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Akinosoglou K\r\nVelissaris D\r\nZiazias D\r\nDavoulos C\r\nTousis A\r\nTsiotsios K\r\nKalogeropoulou C\r\nSpyridonidis A\r\nMarangos M\r\nFligkou F\r\nGogos C","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"Journal of medical virology","abstract":"To date, no therapy has demonstrated definite efficacy for patients with COVID‐19.

However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls).          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, \r\nP\r\n=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, \r\nP\r\n<0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased. Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n

However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls).          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, \r\nP\r\n=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, \r\nP\r\n<0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased. Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n

coranovirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become an important health-care issue worldwide. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also raised concerns among patients with inflammatory rheumatic conditions and their treating physicians. There are emerging data regarding the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 for this particular patient group. However, less is known with regard to the course of COVID-19 among patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors. The aim of the current article is to review the growing body of knowledge on the course/management of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases by presenting a SARS-CoV-2 infected case with ankylosing spondylitis under secukinumab therapy. A 61-year old patient with ankylosing spondylitis who was on secukinumab therapy for 5 months admitted with newly onset fever and gastrointestinal complaints. After being hospitalized, she developed respiratory manifestations with focal pulmonary ground-glass opacities and multiple nodular densities in both lungs. The patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Substantial clinical improvement was obtained following a management plan, which included tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone and enoxaparin sodium. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched by using relevant keywords and their combinations. The literature search revealed four articles reporting the clinical course of COVID-19 in seven rheumatic patients on secukinumab. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mild in most of these patients, while one of them experienced severe COVID-19. Interleukin-17 has been related to the hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19 and IL-17 inhibitors were presented as promising targets for the prevention of aberrant inflammation and acute respiratory distress in COVID-19. However, this hypothesis still remains to be proved. Further studies are warranted in order to test the benefits and risks of IL-inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Ankylosing spondylitis; Biological drugs; COVID-19; Interleukin-17; Rheumatic diseases; Secukinumab; Spondyloarthritis.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Turkey","country_treated":"Turkey","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Ankylosing spondylitis on secukinumab","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"She had a history of ankylosing spondylitis dated back 11 years and over the past 5 months, she had been treated with secukinumab with a good clinical response.

The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related to coronavirus involves a cytokine storm with high serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-γ, IL-1 and IL-12, and IL-8. Similarly, in COVID-19, higher plasma levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, interferon-γ inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP1A), and TNF-α have been found in patients admitted to intensive care units, and the cytokine storm syndrome was proportional to the severity of disease. The proinflammatory IL-6 appears as one of the key cytokines leading to the inflammatory storm, which may result in increased alveolar–capillary blood–gas exchange dysfunction. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 seems to have a prominent role in this inflammatory cascade.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"France","country_treated":"France","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"metastatic sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient was recently diagnosed with metastatic sarcomatous clear cell renal cell carcinoma and had been hospitalized for fever, symptomatic bone metastases pain management, and first-line systemic treatment decisions.

populations emphasized a mild course of disease with severe cases disproportionately affecting infant and comorbid pediatric patients. After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by a SARS-CoV-2-positive female child who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal dysfunction and fluid-refractory hypotension requiring vasopressors and PICU admission.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Child; Coronavirus; Enoxaparin; Pediatric;

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo. En todos los casos la radiografía de tórax era patológica con infiltrado unilateral o bilateral. La procalcitonina demostró no ser suficientemente sensible para detectar la infección neumocócica. La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida.

La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida. Los clínicos deben de ser conscientes de la posible asociación de SARS-CoV-2 y neumococo para evitar errores diagnósticos y retrasos en el tratamiento antibiótico.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Coinfección; Diagnosis; Diagnóstico; S. pneumoniae; Tratamiento; Treatment; co-infection.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":5,"article_patient_number":"4","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"71-80 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"anemia","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection, pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including hypertension (treated with ARBs and diuretic), chronic kidney disease, and chronic anemia.

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus.

We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned.

We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned. Nineteen patients had an uneventful recovery (65.5%). In group 1, 3 of 6 patients died (50%) and 1 of 6 required invasive mechanical ventilation (16.7%). In group 2, 3 of 23 patients died (12.5%). Renal function did not deteriorate and signs of rejection were not observed in any patient on the second treatment regime. In conclusion, immunosuppressant treatment based on cyclosporine could be safe and effective for KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  clinical research/practice; health services and outcomes research; immunosuppressant; kidney disease: infectious; kidney transplantation / nephrology.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":29,"article_patient_number":"18","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Dyslipidemia, obesity, kidney transplant recipient on tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisolone.","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, fever, diarrhea, dyspnea","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a medical history including a kidney transplant in 2011, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes.

These manifestations are linked to a hypercoaguable, pro-inflammatory state with persistent, systemic complement activation. Three critical COVID-19 patients recalcitrant to multiple interventions had skin biopsies documenting deposition of the terminal complement component C5b-9, the lectin complement pathway enzyme MASP2, and C4d in microvascular endothelium. Administration of anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab led to a marked decline in D-dimers and neutrophil counts in all three cases, and normalization of liver functions and creatinine in two. One patient with severe heart failure and AKI had a complete remission. The other two individuals had partial remissions, one with resolution of his AKI but ultimately succumbing to respiratory failure, and another with a significant decline in FiO2 requirements, but persistent renal failure. In conclusion, anti-complement therapy may be beneficial in at least some patients with critical COVID-19.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

All patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and were previously healthy. Clinical presentations were similar with fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal complaints, and/or rash. One patient had altered mental status with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings consistent with aseptic meningitis. Laboratory values were remarkable for high levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimers, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin in all patients. All had low albumin levels. Evaluation for other infectious etiologies was negative. All of the patients were critically ill, requiring admission to the intensive care unit. All had circulatory shock and needed inotropes. Two patients had respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support and one had cardiac dysfunction. All patients received steroids, and two received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). One patient received tocilizumab. None of the children died. MIS-C is a recently recognized pediatric illness spectrum in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical characterization is essential for understanding disease mechanisms to inform clinical

The World Health Organization later named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is no effective treatment available and the data are evolving through continuous clinical trials and ongoing research. Severe infections present with hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome as one of the major complications. We report two cases of COVID-19 patients who initially presented with moderate to severe symptoms. Later, their clinical course worsened despite ongoing treatment with multiple medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin until they were started on tocilizumab. Within a short period after they were administered tocilizumab, their oxygen saturation improved and other inflammatory markers such as D-dimer levels, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels decreased. There is an increase in the amount of research citing the role of various cytokines in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Targeting the inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis, especially interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, would improve overall morbidity and mortality, thus decreasing the burden on healthcare systems.

Administration of anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab led to a marked decline in D-dimers and neutrophil counts in all three cases, and normalization of liver functions and creatinine in two. One patient with severe heart failure and AKI had a complete remission.

The World Health Organization later named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is no effective treatment available and the data are evolving through continuous clinical trials and ongoing research. Severe infections present with hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome as one of the major complications. We report two cases of COVID-19 patients who initially presented with moderate to severe symptoms. Later, their clinical course worsened despite ongoing treatment with multiple medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin until they were started on tocilizumab. Within a short period after they were administered tocilizumab, their oxygen saturation improved and other inflammatory markers such as D-dimer levels, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels decreased. There is an increase in the amount of research citing the role of various cytokines in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Targeting the inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis, especially interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, would improve overall morbidity and mortality, thus decreasing the burden on healthcare systems.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            covid 19; hypoxemic respiratory failure; inflammation; interleukin (il)-6; novel coronavirus; pathophysiology; pneumonia; sars-cov-2; tocilizumab.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":true,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Atrial fibrillation on apixaban","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Bilateral airspace disease, cough, shortness of breath, fever","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Within 24 hours of Tocilizumab treatment, her fevers started trending down, her oxygen saturation improved to mid-90s, and other inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein started trending down.

However, as 50% of the patients remained hospitalised at the time of publication, the authors cannot comment on the duration and eventual outcome of COVID-19 in all of their patients. Furthermore, it is emerging that hydroxychloroquine does not alter COVID-19. As such, we actually believe that other immunosuppressive, antirheumatic medications require more attention. Mathian et al rightfully pointed out that besides long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment, steroids and other baseline immunosuppressant drugs are often present in patients with rheumatic diseases.

Some of them develop a systemic hyperinflammatory state produced by the massive release of inflammatory agents, known as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Inhibition of IL-1 by Anakinra (ANK) is a potential life-saving therapy for severe CSS cases. We propose a rationale for the use of subcutaneous ANK and review our initial experience in a small cohort of severe COVID-19 CSS patients.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients developing ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and exhibiting signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >1000 ng/mL and/or d-dimers > 1.5 μg/mL, plus IL-6 < 40 mg/mL) that received ANK. For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group. Favorable outcome was achieved in 55.6% and 88.9% of the ANK and TCZ cohorts, respectively (p = 0.281). Two patients that failed to respond to TCZ improved after ANK treatment. Aminotransferase levels significantly increased between day 1 and day 7 (p = 0.004) in the TCZ group. Mortality was the same in both groups (11%). There were not any opportunistic infection in the groups nor other adverse effects attributable to treatment.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Overall, 55.6% of COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients treated with ANK exhibited favorable outcome, not inferior to a TCZ treated matched cohort. ANK may be a potential alternative to TCZ for patients with elevated aminotransferases, and may be useful in non-responders to TCZ.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Anakinra; COVID-19; Cytokine storm syndrome; IL-1; SARS-CoV2; Tocilizumab.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Ex-smoker","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"ANK given 4 days after second dose of TCZ\r\nDays from admission to ANK treatment -

We propose a rationale for the use of subcutaneous ANK and review our initial experience in a small cohort of severe COVID-19 CSS patients.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients developing ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and exhibiting signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >1000 ng/mL and/or d-dimers > 1.5 μg/mL, plus IL-6 < 40 mg/mL) that received ANK. For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group. Favorable outcome was achieved in 55.6% and 88.9% of the ANK and TCZ cohorts, respectively (p = 0.281). Two patients that failed to respond to TCZ improved after ANK treatment. Aminotransferase levels significantly increased between day 1 and day 7 (p = 0.004) in the TCZ group. Mortality was the same in both groups (11%). There were not any opportunistic infection in the groups nor other adverse effects attributable to treatment.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Overall, 55.6% of COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients treated with ANK exhibited favorable outcome, not inferior to a TCZ treated matched cohort. ANK may be a potential alternative to TCZ for patients with elevated aminotransferases, and may be useful in non-responders to TCZ.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Anakinra; COVID-19; Cytokine storm syndrome; IL-1; SARS-CoV2; Tocilizumab.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"7","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Days from admission to ANK treatment -
