On presentation, his temperature was 38·1°C. Laboratory tests showed a C-reactive protein concentration of 0·56 mg/dL (normal range 0·00–0·60] mg/dL). Complete blood count showed elevated leukocytes (10060 cells per μL [normal range 3500–9500 cells per μL]), neutrophils (7550 cells per μL [1800–6300 cells per μL]), and monocytes (990 cells per μL [100–600 cells per μL]), while the lymphocyte count (1490 cells per μL) was in the normal range (1100–3200 cells per μL). The patient was negative for influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 viruses.
