Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported as part of the\r\ninitial clinical presentation, but they are rather rare (around 3%-5% depending on the series).2,6,7 Two days later he also had productive cough without dyspnea, and his fever persisted. On the fourth day, he\r\npresented conjunctivitis of his left eye. A chest x-ray showed an opacity compatible with right lower lobe pneumonia, and his CRP rose to 13 mg/dL. This is compatible with serious reported cases, where\r\npneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection. It is characterized primarily by fever and cough, but it is usually accompanied by dyspnea, and bilateral instead of unilateral infiltrates on chest imaging.7 This could be related to the fact that he had a normal total lymphocyte count, and that the severity of the disease has been associated with lymphopenia.8 His conjunctivitis is also an infrequent symptom, that could be explained by evidence that the virus may be present in conjunctival secretions, with around 0.8%of cases presenting with conjunctival congestion.9-13\r\n\r\nOur protocol at patient admission recommended screening for SARS-Cov2 in (1) patients presenting respiratory symptoms and epidemiologic risk of contact with infected or contagious individuals and (2) patients presenting with pneumonia of unknown origin. Nevertheless, in immunocompromised populations, such as SOT recipients, COVID-19 infection should be considered in the presence\r\nof an atypical presentation and screening protocols may be needed to be re-evaluated.

We investigated changes in the fecal fungal microbiomes (mycobiome) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and on recovery.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              We performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 30 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through May 12, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.          \r\n
