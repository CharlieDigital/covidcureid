disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered to be spread primarily by people who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we discuss a patient with severe COVID-19 and a history of type 2 diabetes who had a recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) after recovering. The patient was initially discharged after two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and partially absorbed bilateral lesions on chest computed tomography (CT). However, at his first follow-up, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay with an oropharyngeal swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Despite this, he displayed no obvious clinical symptoms and improved chest CT. The patient was prescribed anti-viral medication. Eight consecutive RT-PCR assays on oropharyngeal swab specimens were conducted after he was re-admitted to our hospital. The results tested positive on the 12th, 14th, 19th, 23rd and 26th of March and negative on the 28th of March, and 6th and 12th of April. After his second discharge, he has tested negative for 5 weeks. This case highlights the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the follow-up period so that an infectivity assessment can be made.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  Coronavirus disease 2019; Recurrence; SARS-CoV-2; Severe; Type 2 diabetes.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"pneumonia, respiratory tract infection","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"5 weeks","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient has a history of diabetes.
