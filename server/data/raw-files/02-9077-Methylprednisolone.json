He has been living in Chengdu, Sichuan province, for a long time. However, his mother had traveled to Wuhan a week ago and was diagnosed with the new coronavirus after she got back home. He has referred to the emergency department of our institution on 2 February 2020. General physical examination showed that moist rales were audible over both lungs, and the body temperature was 36.7C, and other results were unremarkable. The laboratory tests showed that white blood cell count kept in the normal range (5.11  109/l), and the differential count showed decreased lymphocyte (16.8%, normal range 20–50%) and increased C-reactive protein (22.50 mg/l; normal\r\nrange <5 mg/l). Chest computed tomography (CT) (2 February 2020) showed that there were ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both in bilateral lungs (Figure 1A). Considering the contact history with his mother and the CT features, a real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient’s throat swab was performed, and the patient was confirmed with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving 3 days of treatment with an antiviral (Veletonavir, [also known as Lopinavir-Ritonavir]), and anti-inflammatory (Methylprednisolone), the patient’s cough was relieved, and repeated chest CT (5 February 2020) showed the extent and density of lesions were significantly decreased (Figure 1B). Laboratory tests, however, showed that lymphocytes were still reduced, and erythrocyte sedimentation\r\nrate was increased. On 6 February 2020, the patient began to have a fever (body temperature 38.6C) then additional antibiotics (Piperacillin–tazobactam) was given. Unfortunately, 2 days later, the patient’s body temperature reached a maximum of 39.0C, accompanied by a paroxysmal cough, and the whole body’s skin was flushing. CT images (9 February 2020) manifested as extensive groundglass opacities, consolidation in bilateral lungs. Oddly, compared with CT images of the last two times (Figure 1C), all the lesions were found in different locations (Figure 1D). On 11 February 2020, he received a real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the throat swab again, and the results were still positive.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8783,9077,9780]},{"id":5383,"regimens":[{"id":9975,"duration":{"id":4084,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9077,"name":"Methylprednisolone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9077","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5748,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9975},{"id":5749,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":9975}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:34.802635Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:18.850786Z","dose":"80mg","frequency":"BID","route":"IV","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5383},{"id":9976,"duration":{"id":4082,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8462,"name":"Interferon Alfa-2B","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8462","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5750,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9976},{"id":5751,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":9976}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:34.807932Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:10.466092Z","dose":"5 million units","frequency":"BID","route":"atomisation inhalation","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5383},{"id":9977,"duration":{"id":4083,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5752,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":9977},{"id":5753,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":9977}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:34.813713Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:20:10.463358Z","dose":"500 mg","frequency":"BID","route":"oral","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5383}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":11747,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5383},{"id":11837,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5383},{"id":11838,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5383}],"author_username":"CURE ID Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"FDA/NCATS","author_country":"United States","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3200,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5383}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-04-30T01:36:34.783570Z","updated":"2020-05-06T00:19:55.911833Z","title":"Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32085846,"doi":"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-X","article_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32085846","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Xu Z, Shi L, Wang Y, Zhang J, Huang L, Zhang C, Liu S, Zhao P, Liu H, Zhu L, Tai Y, Bai C, Gao T, Song J, Xia P, Dong J, Zhao J, Wang FS","article_author_email":"","journal":"The Lancet.

Chest x-ray showed multiple patchy shadows in both lungs (appendix p 2), and a throat swab sample was taken. On Jan 22 (day 9 of illness), the Beijing Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed by reverse real-time PCR assay that the patient had COVID-19. He was immediately admitted to the isolation ward and received supplemental oxygen through a face mask. He\r\nwas given interferon alfa-2b (5 million units twice daily, atomisation inhalation) and lopinavir plus ritonavir (500 mg twice daily, orally) as antiviral therapy, and moxifloxacin (0·4 g once daily, intravenously) to prevent secondary infection. Given the serious shortness of breath and hypoxaemia, methylprednisolone (80 mg twice daily, intravenously) was administered to attenuate lung inflammation. Laboratory tests results are listed in the appendix (p 4). After receiving medication, his body temperature reduced from 39·0 to 36·4 °C. However, his cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue did not improve.

Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses.

Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the expression of 2019-nCoV proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. \r\nResults:\r\n Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous exudation and fibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils were also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type II alveolar epithelia and focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization of exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosiswere observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type II alveolar epithelia were observed under electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Decreased numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen. Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes of chronic diseases were observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection was observed in these organs. \r\nConclusion:\r\n s The lungs from novel coronavirus pneumonia patients manifest significant pathological lesions, including the alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation. While the 2019-nCoV is mainly distributed in lung, the infection also involves in the damages of heart, vessels, liver, kidney and other organs. Further studies are warranted to investigate the mechanism underlying pathological changes of this disease.","article_type":"","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":false,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"","country_treated":"","began_treatment_year":"","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"diabetes, double lung bronchiectasis","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"","clinical_syndrome":"Hypothermia, cough, running nose and fatigue","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"","additional_info":"Ever on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: NR\r\nAuthor defined severe?: NR\r\nJustification for author-indicated response: \"The total course of disease from onset to death is 17-19 days\"\r\nDay in disease course that symptoms were noted to begin improving: NR\r\nDay in disease course that full resolution of symptoms was noted: NR\r\nDay in disease course that patient was discharged if admitted: NR","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8412,11312,9077,11388,11327]},{"id":5424,"regimens":[{"id":10123,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":11312,"name":"Interferon Alfa-1B","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11312","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5782,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10123},{"id":5783,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10123}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.155389Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.576283Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424},{"id":10124,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":11388,"name":"Pinavir/ Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11388","rxNorm_id":23,"notes":""},"use_drug":[{"id":5784,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10124},{"id":5785,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10124}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.160786Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.618267Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424},{"id":10125,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":11327,"name":"Thymosin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11327","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5786,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10125},{"id":5787,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10125}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.166097Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.584487Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424},{"id":10126,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":9077,"name":"Methylprednisolone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9077","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5788,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10126},{"id":5789,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10126}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.171494Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.588084Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424},{"id":10127,"duration":null,"drug":{"id":8412,"name":"Immunoglobulins, Intravenous","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8412","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":5790,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10127},{"id":5791,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10127}],"created":"2020-04-30T01:38:22.177494Z","updated":"2020-10-05T23:16:05.592016Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5424}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":11788,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5424},{"id":11849,"answer":"Pathology","answer_other":"","report":5424}],"author_username":"CURE ID Admin","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1892,"name":"Coronavirus -

Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the expression of 2019-nCoV proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. \r\nResults:\r\n Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous exudation and fibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils were also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type II alveolar epithelia and focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization of exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosiswere observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type II alveolar epithelia were observed under electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Decreased numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen. Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes of chronic diseases were observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection was observed in these organs. \r\nConclusion:\r\n s The lungs from novel coronavirus pneumonia patients manifest significant pathological lesions, including the alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation. While the 2019-nCoV is mainly distributed in lung, the infection also involves in the damages of heart, vessels, liver, kidney and other organs.

Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":true,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[8783,9077,11327,10942]},{"id":5943,"regimens":[{"id":11128,"duration":{"id":5187,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":11301,"name":"Remdesivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11301","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7489,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11128},{"id":8360,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11128}],"created":"2020-09-16T19:01:17.935058Z","updated":"2020-10-01T06:07:09.253832Z","dose":"200mg loading dose, then 100 mg once a day","frequency":"","route":"IV","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"Patient was intubated during start of treatment","comments":null,"report":5943},{"id":11129,"duration":{"id":5188,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9077,"name":"Methylprednisolone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9077","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7490,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11129},{"id":8361,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11129}],"created":"2020-09-16T19:01:17.942658Z","updated":"2020-10-01T06:07:09.260259Z","dose":"0.8 mg/kg","frequency":"","route":"IV","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"Patient had started drug before disease worsened and needed to be intubated","comments":null,"report":5943}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7783,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5943},{"id":7784,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5943}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13247,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5943},{"id":13248,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5943}],"author_username":"Kate Borkowski","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Nurse","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3885,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5943}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[],"created":"2020-09-16T18:54:39.296415Z","updated":"2020-10-01T06:07:09.244695Z","title":"A possible role for B cells in COVID-19?

Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID-19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36-year-old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID-19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug-to-drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO-incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course. In addition, antiviral agents should be used cautiously, especially in patients on calcineurin inhibitors.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  clinical research/practice; immunosuppressant; infection and infectious agents - viral; infectious disease; kidney (allograft) function/dysfunction; kidney transplantation/nephrology.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Korea, Republic of","country_treated":"Korea, Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"ESRD with living unrelated donor transplant in April 2016","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Atelectasis","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"On hospital day 2, the fever spiked to 38.5°C, and we decided to discontinue the MMF and to start lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg, bid).

He did not need supplementary oxygen. The only remarkable finding in blood analysis was hyperglycemia, which was related to corticosteroid treatment. At discharge, 32 mg/day of methylprednisolone were prescribed during 4 more days. At the time the patient came to the emergency department, he was not taking corticoids any longer. Physical examination at the emergency department revealed no pathological findings. He had neither fever nor dyspnea. A brain CT was reported not observing intracranial acute pathology. Urine toxic screening was negative for cocaine, cannabis, opioids and benzodiazepines. \r\n\r\nHe had a full-recovery after 1 month hospitalized.

He required volume expansion. He was transferred to the PICU due to hemodynamic instability. Inotropic support with norepinephrine was initiated and maintained for 24 hours.\r\nWhile in the PICU, the patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain. \r\nSuspecting sepsis of abdominal origin, the attending physician replaced cefotaxime with piperacillin–tazobactam.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342,8783,9077]},{"id":6124,"regimens":[{"id":11573,"duration":{"id":5621,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":8235,"answer":"To

Thus far, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. The immune system and inflammation are proposed to play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. Intravenous infusion of MSCs has shown promising results in COVID-19 treatment. Here, we report a case of a severe COVID-19 patient treated with human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (hWJCs) from a healthy donor in Liaocheng People's Hospital, China, from February 24, 2020. The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment. After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition. This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"6 days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"According to the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 [14], the patient was treated with antiviral therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, IFN-α inhalation, and also intravenous injection of levofloxacin, tanreqing capsule, xuebijing, thymosin α1, methylprednisolone, and immunoglobulin. During this time, the patient received antipyretic therapy. More treatments were conducted consisting of electrocardiograph monitoring, potassium chloride sustained-release tablets (oral, 1 g per time, 2 times per day), plasma exchange and regulated intestinal microflora of patient, etc. Finally, the discomfort was released, and the oxygen saturation increased to 98%. On February 13 to 21, the patient’s vital physical signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers and shortness of breath.\r\nOn February 22, the patient took a turn for the worse. Considering the severe organ injury caused by an inflammatory response, hWJC adoptive transfer therapy was proposed under the advice and guidance of the specialist group. The family member and patient agreed to try hWJC adoptive transfer therapy. The therapeutic scheme was then discussed and approved by the ethics committee of the hospital, and consent forms were signed by the family member before the therapy.

Her lowest documented blood pressure within 24 hours of admission was 79/39 mm Hg. Notable laboratory findings on admission included elevated inflammatory markers, hyperferritinemia, hyponatremia, and acute kidney injury. Nasopharyngeal SARSCoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was negative. Chest radiography demonstrated bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and bedside cardiac ultrasound demonstrated moderately diminished left ventricular (LV) function. She was emergently intubated and started on vasoactive infusions. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from tracheal aspirates were negative on 2 repeat samples. Vancomycin, cefepime, clindamycin, and doxycycline were started empirically for concern of toxic shock syndrome or rickettsial disease. \r\n\r\nOver the first 5 hospital days (HD), she had intermittent fevers and developed thrombocytopenia, mild coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, and leukocytosis. To evaluate for incomplete Kawasaki disease/Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, an echocardiogram was performed on HD 6 that demonstrated normal biventricular systolic function (shortening fraction [SF], 38%; normal, 28%–45%) but identified right coronary artery dilation (Boston z score, 3.15). She was then treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg, methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day, and low-dose aspirin. Her fever resolved on HD 6.

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

It is largely unknown whether the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic immune diseases has some specific manifestations, or makes them more prone to rapidly progress into severe COVID-19. In this case report, we describe the clinical features of 5 rheumatic immune disease patients with the concomitant presence of COVID-19. Amongst these patients, 4 had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 1 had systemic sclerosis (SSc). Two patients had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient. The age of the patients ranged between 51 and 79 years. Fever (80%), cough (80%), dyspnea (40%), and fatigue (20%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Laboratory investigations revealed leukopenia and lymphopenia in 2 patients. In all the patients, chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed patchy ground glass opacities in the lungs. During the hospital stay, the condition of two patients remained the same (i.e., mild COVID-19), two patients progressed to the severe COVID-19, and one patient worsened to the critically ill COVID-19. These patients were treated with antiviral agents for COVID-19, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, and immunomodulatory agents for rheumatic immune diseases. All the patients responded well, were cured of COVID-19, and subsequently discharged.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Coronavirus; Rheumatic immune disease;

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case

We reduced immunosuppressive regimen in all these patients, typically holding the antiproliferative agent and augmenting steroids; everybody received hydroxychloroquine, initial empiric antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam, and high-dose low molecular weight heparin. Clinical course seemed favorable in three of our patients, but one of them deteriorated after 10 days of hospitalization, probably due to an acute form of graft dysfunction triggered both by COVID-19 and a nosocomial bacterial infection, and eventually died. Although short-term prognosis could be considered benign in the majority of our patients, we should carefully monitor these individuals in order to detect early sign of clinical deterioration and graft dysfunction in the next few months.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Series","number_of_patients":4,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":true,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Non‐specific interstitial pneumonia status post lung transplant on prednisone, tacrolimus and azathioprine.

pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus have been discovered in Wuhan, China, and such cases have spread nationwide quickly. At present, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic. What are the clinical features of this disease? What is the clinical diagnosis and how should such patients be treated? As a clinician, mastery of the clinical characteristics, basic diagnosis, and treatment methods of COVID-19 are required to provide help to patients.          \r\n        Case summary:      \r\n              A 40-some-old patient with a cough lasting 6 d without obvious cause, as well as fever and fatigue for 1 d, was admitted to Hankou Hospital on January 22, 2020 and transferred to Huoshenshan Hospital on February 4. The main clinical symptoms were dry cough, fatigue, and fever. He was diagnosed with COVID-19. From the 4\r\nth\r\n d of admission, the patient's condition gradually worsened, with increased respiratory rate and body temperature. Peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased progressively. On the 8\r\nth\r\n d of admission, the patient's highest temperature was 40.7 °C, and oxygen saturation was 83% despite high-flow oxygen inhalation. Chest computed tomography results showed that the virus progressed rapidly. The number of lesions significantly increased with expanded scope and increased density. The distribution of lesions advanced from peripheral to central. In addition to nasal catheter oxygen inhalation and symptomatic support, antiviral drugs were used throughout the treatment. On January 22, oseltamivir phosphate capsules were given orally (75 mg, twice daily) for 6 d. On January 24, three tablets of lopinavir and ritonavir were added orally (twice daily). After 6 d, this was changed to 0.2 g (two tablets) arbidol, taken orally (three times daily) for 5 d. During the severe stage, methylprednisolone was given (40 mg) once every 12 h, immunoglobulin (20 g) was administered by intravenous drip infusion once daily, and thymosin (1.6 mg) was injected subcutaneously once daily combined with immunotherapy. On February 2, symptoms decreased, various indicators improved, and pulmonary inflammation was obviously reduced. Throat swabs on February 4 and 9 were negative for novel coronavirus nucleic acid. After 19 d in the hospital, the patient was successfully treated and discharged.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              COVID-19 in young adults can be successfully treated with active treatment. We report a typical case of COVID-19, analyze its clinical characteristics, summarize its clinical diagnosis and treatment experience, and provide a reference for clinical colleagues.          \r\n

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned.

Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned.

Nineteen patients had an uneventful recovery (65.5%). In group 1, 3 of 6 patients died (50%) and 1 of 6 required invasive mechanical ventilation (16.7%). In group 2, 3 of 23 patients died (12.5%). Renal function did not deteriorate and signs of rejection were not observed in any patient on the second treatment regime. In conclusion, immunosuppressant treatment based on cyclosporine could be safe and effective for KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  clinical research/practice; health services and outcomes research; immunosuppressant; kidney disease: infectious; kidney transplantation / nephrology.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":29,"article_patient_number":"12","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"kidney transplant recipient in 2020 on tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisolone.

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus.

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned. Nineteen patients had an uneventful recovery (65.5%). In group 1, 3 of 6 patients died (50%) and 1 of 6 required invasive mechanical ventilation (16.7%). In group 2, 3 of 23 patients died (12.5%).

We report the fundamental pathological investigation in the lungs and other organs of fatal cases for the mechanistic understanding of severe COVID-19 and the development of specific therapy in these cases.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              The autopsy and pathological investigations of specimens were performed on bodies of two deceased cases with COVID-19. Gross anatomy and histological investigation by Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained were reviewed on each patient. Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining and Masson staining were performed for the examinations of mucus, fibrin and collagen fiber in lung tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on the slides of lung tissues from two patients. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Flow cytometry analyses were performed to detect the direct binding of S protein and the expression of ACE2 on the cell surface of macrophages.          \r\n        Findings:      \r\n              The main pathological features in lungs included extensive impairment of type I alveolar epithelial cells and atypical hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells, with formation of hyaline membrane, focal hemorrhage, exudation and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary consolidation. The mucous plug with fibrinous exudate in the alveoli and the dysfunction of alveolar macrophages were characteristic abnormalities. The type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages in alveoli and pulmonary hilum lymphoid tissue were infected by SARS-CoV-2. S protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly bound to the macrophage via the S-protein-ACE2 interaction.          \r\n        Interpretation:      \r\n              Infection of alveolar macrophage by SARS-CoV-2 might be drivers of the \"cytokine storm\", which might result in damages in pulmonary tissues, heart and lung, and lead to the failure of multiple organs .          \r\n        Funding:      \r\n

throughout a patient's lifetime. Moreover, viral pathogens have been proven to be the leading contributors to myopericarditis in the pediatric and adult populations. Despite the current comprehensive knowledge of myocardial injury in viral and post-viral myopericarditis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced myopericarditis are poorly understood. This report presents a case of coronavirus (COVID-19) fulminant myopericarditis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a middle-aged male patient: a 50-SOME-old man with a history of hypertension who arrived to the emergency department with a dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, resulting in the patient's admission to the airborne isolation unit for clinical observation. When his condition began to deteriorate, the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit after electrocardiography detected cardiac injury, demonstrating diffuse ST-segment elevation. Laboratory evaluations revealed elevated troponin T and BNP, with an echocardiogram indicating global left ventricular hypokinesia and a reduced ejection fraction. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dobutamine, remdesivir, and ventilatory support. This specific case highlights the severity and complications that may arise as a direct result of COVID-19 infection.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  ards; coronavirus

Its diagnosis might be challenging. We present two critically ill patients with COVID-19 who presented acutely altered mental status as the main manifestation of multiple strokes.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up of the patients.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Two patients in their sixties were hospitalized with a bilateral pneumonia COVID-19. They developed respiratory failure and were admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilation and intense medical treatment. They were started on low-molecular-weight heparin since admission. Their laboratory results showed lymphopenia and increased levels of C-reactive protein and D-dimer. Case 1 developed hypofibrinogenemia and presented several cutaneous lesions with biopsy features of thrombotic vasculopathy. Case 2 was performed a CT pulmonary angiogram at ICU showing a bilateral pulmonary embolism. When waking up, both patients were conscious but with a remarkable global altered mental status without focal neurological deficits. A brain MRI revealed multiple acute bilateral ischemic lesions with areas of hemorrhagic transformation in both patients (case 1: affecting the left frontal and temporal lobes and both occipital lobes; case 2: affecting both frontal and left occipital lobes). Cardioembolic source and acquired antiphospholipid syndrome were ruled out. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy was suspected as the possible main etiology of the strokes.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Acutely altered mental status might be the main manifestation of multiple brain infarctions in critically ill COVID-19 patients. It should be specially considered in those with suspected COVID-19-associated coagulopathy.

Some of them develop a systemic hyperinflammatory state produced by the massive release of inflammatory agents, known as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Inhibition of IL-1 by Anakinra (ANK) is a potential life-saving therapy for severe CSS cases. We propose a rationale for the use of subcutaneous ANK and review our initial experience in a small cohort of severe COVID-19 CSS patients.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients developing ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and exhibiting signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >1000 ng/mL and/or d-dimers > 1.5 μg/mL, plus IL-6 < 40 mg/mL) that received ANK. For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group.

Some of them develop a systemic hyperinflammatory state produced by the massive release of inflammatory agents, known as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Inhibition of IL-1 by Anakinra (ANK) is a potential life-saving therapy for severe CSS cases. We propose a rationale for the use of subcutaneous ANK and review our initial experience in a small cohort of severe COVID-19 CSS patients.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients developing ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and exhibiting signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >1000 ng/mL and/or d-dimers > 1.5 μg/mL, plus IL-6 < 40 mg/mL) that received ANK. For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group. Favorable outcome was achieved in 55.6% and 88.9% of the ANK and TCZ cohorts, respectively (p = 0.281). Two patients that failed to respond to TCZ improved after ANK treatment. Aminotransferase levels significantly increased between day 1 and day 7 (p = 0.004) in the TCZ group. Mortality was the same in both groups (11%).

Some of them develop a systemic hyperinflammatory state produced by the massive release of inflammatory agents, known as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Inhibition of IL-1 by Anakinra (ANK) is a potential life-saving therapy for severe CSS cases. We propose a rationale for the use of subcutaneous ANK and review our initial experience in a small cohort of severe COVID-19 CSS patients.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients developing ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and exhibiting signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >1000 ng/mL and/or d-dimers > 1.5 μg/mL, plus IL-6 < 40 mg/mL) that received ANK. For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group. Favorable outcome was achieved in 55.6% and 88.9% of the ANK and TCZ cohorts, respectively (p = 0.281). Two patients that failed to respond to TCZ improved after ANK treatment. Aminotransferase levels significantly increased between day 1 and day 7 (p = 0.004) in the TCZ group. Mortality was the same in both groups (11%). There were not any opportunistic infection in the groups nor other adverse effects attributable to treatment.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Overall, 55.6% of COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients treated with ANK exhibited favorable outcome, not inferior to a TCZ treated matched cohort.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used controller medications in patients with asthma. It is unclear whether ICS use increases the risk for severe COVID-19 infection. At the current time, asthma organizations are still recommending the continued use of ICS and other asthma medications to minimize the risk of uncontrolled asthma. However, for patients with asthma and who have recovered from COVID-19 infection, the timing of resumption of asthma therapy is equally uncertain. Pulmonary function testing and exhaled oral nitric oxide testing are aerosol-generating procedures and are currently being severely restricted at most health-care facilities. We presented a case of a patient with cough-variant asthma who developed severe COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome with the need for intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was defined as requiring 15 liters of supplemental oxygen via a nonrebreather mask combined with 6-liter nasal cannula or use of ≥95% oxygen by high-flow nasal cannula. We excluded patients in whom there was suspicion of bacterial infection or who were receiving immunosuppressants. Subcutaneous anakinra was initiated at 100 mg every 6 hours and gradually tapered off completely. The primary outcome was the prevention of mechanical ventilation.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Of the 14 patients who met the criteria, 11 patients received anakinra for a maximum of 19 days. Seven of the patients who started anakinra treatment ≤36 hours after onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure did not require mechanical ventilation, and all were discharged home. Four patients who started anakinra ≥4 days after onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure required mechanical ventilation. Of those, 3 patients were extubated (2 discharged home and 1 remained hospitalized), and 1 died. All 3 patients who met the criteria but did not receive anakinra required mechanical ventilation.

Real-time RT-PCR assays are recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19. Here we report a rare case of COVID-19 with multiple negative results for PCR assays outside Wuhan, China.    \r\n          Case presentation:        \r\n            A 32-year old male was admitted to our hospital because of 6 days of unexplained fever on January 29, 2020. He had come from Wuhan city 10 days before admission. Five days before admission, no abnormality was noted in laboratory test, chest radiography, and nasopharyngeal swab test for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The patient was treated with ibuprofen for alleviating fever. On admission, chest computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacities in right lower lung field. COVID-19 was suspected. Three times of nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected after admission. However, none of the specimens were positive. The patient was confirmed with COVID-19 after fifth SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. He was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, recombinant human interferon alfa-2b inhalation, methylprednisolone. After 18 days of treatment, he was discharged with improved symptoms, lung lesions and negative results of nasopharyngeal swab.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            This case reminds clinician that a patient with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but multiple negative RT-PCR result should not be taken out of isolation. A combination of patient's exposure history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and typical imaging findings plays a vital role in making preliminary diagnosis and guide early isolation and treatment. Repeat swab tests are helpful in diagnosis for this kind of patients.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            Coronavirus disease 2019; False negative; Real-time RT-PCR; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"31-40 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Fever, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, fatigue, and myalgia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Five days before admission, no abnormality was noted in laboratory test, chest radiography, and nasopharyngeal swab test for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid.

He visited Wuhan 8 days ago. At admission, nasopharyngeal swab samples were taken, and polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA positivity. On day 9, after admission, the chest computed tomography scan showed diffuse ground-glass shadows in the patient's bilateral lungs. On day 11, his respiratory symptoms worsened. Subsequently, type I respiratory failure was diagnosed, coinciding with kidney injury, and subsequently, type II respiratory failure occurred, coupled with multiorgan failure including the heart and liver. However, the patient's constitution worsened although SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative since day 13. He died on day 21. Lung biopsy showed areas of diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by extensive acute alveolitis with numerous intra-alveolar neutrophil, lymphocyte, and macrophage infiltrations. Microthrombi were seen in the dilated pulmonary capillaries. Immunohistochemistry staining for SARS-CoV-2 N protein was negative. Taken together, the patient died of multiorgan failure although the SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared already, implicating that for disease worsening, no active SARS-CoV-2 infection is required.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Clinical manifestation and lung histological alteration showed that this patient suffered from SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia.
