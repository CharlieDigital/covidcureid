Although the discussion of cardiac pathology is probably of interest to some, the main message is that if you have COVID19 and you delay treatment until your PO2 is 44, you're dead. Beyond that, it is a mistake to give high-dose HCQ and Zithromax loading doses because the latter will induce toxic levels of the former. HCQ doses should be limited to 200mg BID and Zithromax should be 250 BID. Going higher on either of these meds is asking for trouble. How do I know?

The putative mechanism might be prevention of  secondary bacterial infection in cytokine-insulted alveoli however it may be due to macrolide CYA-3A4 inhibition with elevation of hydroxychloroquine levels, perhaps unpredictably. \r\n\r\nCase Report: Patient was male in 50s with no prior medical condition presenting 3/27/20 with fever and dyspnea negative for influenza A and B and RSV but positive for COVID 19 (PHI removed by moderator MD). Patient in moderate respiratory distress with bilateral crackles. Lab values: WBC 20.7k/L with neutrophilic predominance (92%) and lymphopenia (2.8%). Lab values: PaO2 44 on FiO2 100%. Serum K (5.0mg/dL, normal 3.5–5.1 mg/dL) and Mg (1.9 mg/dL, normal 1.6–2.3 mg/dL). Serum Ca was low (7.7 mg/dL, normal 8.4-10.4 mg/dL) and phosphate high (9.0 mg/dL, normal < 4.5 mg/dL) in keeping with acute renal failure with Cr rising from 2.4 to 6.5mg/dl (normal < 1.1 mg/dL) within 24h of admission. AST (166 U/L, normal <59 U/L)  and LDH (3546 U/L, normal <618 U/L) and PT/ INR 14.6s/1.3 (normal <12.9s/<1.16) but normal ALT. Imaging: CXR revealed bilateral peripheral focal consolidation and right pleural effusion. Baseline EKG sinus rhythm QT/QTc 298/403 msec figure 1a). Treatment & Outcome: Patient was admitted to ICU telemetry, intubated and started on hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID day one then 200mg BID and azithromycin 500 mg day one then 250mg daily. Day 2 EKG revealed repeated torsades de pointes though QT/QTc remained normal (250/427 msec fig 1b). Six hours later patient experienced cardiac arrest. Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful, despite defibrillation.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: Both HC and AZ are capable of prolonging QT(3,4) and macrolide (AZ) is a well-known CYA-3A4 inhibitor which may decrease HC metabolism raising the potential for cardiotoxic accumulation and arrhythmia. Doses of HC as high as 1200mg are being suggested(1).  In view of the beneficial results with HC alone(2) perhaps the initial loading dose of AZ might be omitted particularly in patients with multiorgan failure. Prophylactic mexiletine might also be considered based on the prior efficacy of quinidine mexiletine combinations(5). Notably, there was no premonitory QT prolongation documented prior to or concurrent with torsades.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"Acute renal failure, Hepatic

He had an episode of lip, tongue and preorbital swelling associated with tightnes","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"The patient was not previously treated for this infection","unusual":"Date of presentation: The onset of symptoms began in early 2020 with urticaria (PHI removed by moderator PP). \r\nCase Presentation: A man in his early 80s presented with a two days history of daily generalized hives (PHI removed by moderator PP). The hives are pruritic, red wheals that range from 1.5 to 8.0 cm (0.5 to 3 in.) in diameter. He had an episode of lip, tongue and preorbital swelling associated with tightness of the throat. The patient was investigated for other differential diagnosis of urticaria at the time, such as parasitic and bacterial infection, for which negative results were found. The patient reported these symptoms plus general malaise, fatigue, 37.9⁰C temperature and sore throat (PHI removed by moderator PP). The dry cough and an episode of unconsciousness were the other symptoms that the patient had experienced. Hypothyroidism and hypertension are in his medical history which are controlled with Levothyroxine 100 µg and Ramipril 10mg daily. After the unconsciousness episode, he was admitted at the hospital. \r\nPhysical Exam: He was re-evaluated because he presented with an episode of unconsciousness, dry cough, general malaise, fatigue and with body temperature of 37.9°C (PHI removed by moderator PP).\r\nLaboratory Findings: \r\nThe initial biochemical tests showed that the patient presented with low numbers of white blood cells (WBC) (WBC=2.75x103). The most hallmark issue which is lymphopenia was detected in this case (lymphocytes= 852). The other blood tests results were found to be normal. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Covid19 was not performed due to the time lapse between starting the symptoms and hospital admission. By considering with sustained community transmission, RT-PCR of viral nucleic acid could be supported by more versatile diagnostic tools because of concern over false-negative results and limited availability.  Therefore, the CT chest was carried out during the patient admission.\r\nPertinent imaging: CT chest was carried out during the patient admission which showed pneumonia with bilateral and subpleural areas of ground-glass opacification, consolidation affecting the lower lobes. \r\nTreatment: The patient was admitted to National Oil Company of Iran Central Hospital. Treatment was started with Azithromycin 500 mg/daily at the hospital. At the time of his hospital admission, the patient was observed for his consciousness and lymphopenia. As a precaution, due to existing patient health conditions, hydroxychloroquine was not administrated.  Five days after receiving treatment and observation, the patient's symptoms such as cough, fatigue and loss of appetite, had improved by 80%.\r\nLesson learned: This report highlights the unusual clinical presentation of a patient with COVID-19. There is a possibility a patient may initially present with a skin rash such as urticaria, however this skin manifestation can cloud the diagnosis and thus lead to misdiagnosis for another common disease. Despite skin manifestations such as urticaria displaying different laboratory findings to that seen of COVID-19, for example the high level of leukocytes seen in urticaria compared to leukopenia in COVID-19, researchers should look at the possibility of an alternative mechanism which can leads to the formation of such skin manifestations. This report presents evidence regarding a possible association between urticarial skin manifestations in the early stages of COVID-19 and thus its use as a possible early diagnostic indicator. Clinicians should take this report into considerations in order to prevent misdiagnosis as well to allow early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"3 weeks","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"2 weeks","additional_info":"Urticaria (angioedema) and COVID- 19 infection\r\nMojgan Najafzadeh1, Fanila Shahzad1, Nader Ghaderi2, Kaveh Ansari3, Badie Jacob2, Andrew Wright2\r\n\r\n1 School of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford, BD7 1DP, UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: (A) shows cutaneous manifestation of urticaria.

As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China. Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, β-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus titers were observed.\r\n© 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"Korea, Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"none","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, GI Tract","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, Diarrhea, Headache","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"First case of tertiary transmission in Korea","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":true,"adverse_events":"psychiatric symptoms thought to be due to isolation and negative social media","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"2 weeks","additional_info":"A 54-year-old Korean man living in Wuhan, China entered Korea on January 20, 2020 and felt the first symptoms of chills and muscle pain on January 22. After contacting a public health center on January 25, he was isolated in a negative pressure room at Myongji Hospital and confirmed to have COVID-19 on January 26.\r\n\r\nAt that time the initial confirmation of COVID-19 was made by pan-coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction assay and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons using a throat swab.\r\n\r\nThe index patient transmitted the virus to his friend (patient A) at a restaurant on the 1st day of the symptoms. And then patient A (confirmed on January 30, 2020) transmitted COVID-19 to his spouse and son (confirmed on January 31, 2020), and a church colleague (confirmed on February 6, 2020). Those were the first cases of tertiary transmission of COVID-19 outside China.\r\n\r\nThe index patient was a clothing worker at the Wuhan Fashion Center, with a height of 193 cm and weight of 96 kg (body mass index, 25.7), and had no major illness. He denied any smoking and drinking history.\r\n\r\nOn admission day, he had no respiratory symptoms and blood pressure of 152/93 mmHg, pulse rate of 73 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.0°C. On physical examination, no pharyngeal injection, clear lung sounds, and no haziness on chest X-ray were observed. Tests for Leptospira, Hantan virus, Tsutsugamushi, Malaria, M tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Ag/Ab, and venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test were all negative.\r\n\r\nHe developed fever and dry cough on days 5 and 7 of illness, respectively, but he had no serious respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, productive sputum or chest pain. Small consolidation in right upper lobe and ground-glass opacities in both lower lobes were observed on high-resolution computed tomography scan.\r\n\r\nThe initial viral load could not be measured because real-time PCR was not available when the patient was diagnosed. So we measured viral loads using quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR since Jan. 31, 2020. Viral RNA was extracted from the sputum using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All quantitative real-time PCR amplifications were performed using Quantstudio 1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and PowerCheck™ SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time PCR kit (KogeneBiotech, Seoul, Korea).\r\n\r\nThere were some reports about lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) for the treatment of COVID-19.1\r\nLopinavir/ritonavir was started from the hospital day 8 (day 10 of illness); 2 tablets (lopinavir 200 mg/ritonavir 50 mg) were given per oral bid. Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).  It is possible that the decreased load of SARS-CoV-2 resulted from the natural course of the healing process rather than administration of lopinavir/ritonavir, or both. Therefore, more data need to be collected to figure out the direct effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on treatment with COVID-19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive)?: No\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that symptoms were noted to begin improving: 11\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that full resolution of symptoms was noted: 18\r\n\r\nDay in disease course that patient was discharged if admitted: 19\r\n\r\nJustification for timing of resolution: Admitted on Jan 25, 2020. Lopinavir/ritonavir started on Feb 1, 2020. Discharged on Feb 10, 2020.  Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6675,8711,8783,9640,10547]},{"id":5516,"regimens":[{"id":10287,"duration":{"id":4254,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6131,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10287},{"id":6132,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10287}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:41:00.950358Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.635450Z","dose":"200 mg x 2","frequency":"BD","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5516},{"id":10288,"duration":{"id":4255,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":7166,"name":"Darunavir-Cobicistat","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/7166","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6133,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10288},{"id":6134,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10288}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:41:00.958865Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.642406Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5516},{"id":10289,"duration":{"id":542,"approximate_duration":"","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":6675,"name":"Ceftriaxone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6675","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6135,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10289},{"id":6136,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10289}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:54:22.418355Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.648812Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5516},{"id":10290,"duration":{"id":466,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":6137,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10290},{"id":6138,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10290}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:54:22.423472Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.655168Z","dose":null,"frequency":"","route":"","severity":null,"severity_detail":null,"comments":null,"report":5516}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7261,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5516},{"id":7262,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5516},{"id":7263,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5516}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":12057,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5516},{"id":12058,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5516},{"id":12059,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5516}],"author_username":"Parvesh Paul","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.","author_country":"India","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3338,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5516}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"}],"races":[{"id":29,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-05-14T12:39:53.704400Z","updated":"2020-05-14T13:05:25.626306Z","title":"Benign COVID-19 in an immunocompromised cancer patient -  the case of a married couple.

A married couple (age 60 years) was simultaneously admitted to the emergency department on 10 March 2020 because of dyspnoea and fever, consistent with COVID-19. The wife (patient 1) was partially immunocompromised as a consequence of a recently started chemotherapy with fulvestrant and abemaciclid for recurring breast cancer, her husband (patient 2) had been healthy except for a history of controlled arterial hypertension. Both patients were treated with darunavir/cobicistat and hydroxychloroquine. The clinical course of the immunocompromised partner was benign, without need of intensive care. She was able to leave the hospital on day 6 after admission. In contrast, her husband needed intensive care and his recovery was slow, although eventually successful too. These findings suggest that the course of COVID-19 is not necessarily ominous in the presence of a compromised immune response and tend to reinforce the emerging therapeutic concepts of a controlled mitigation of the immune cascade following SARS CoV-2 infection.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Arterial hypertension, controlled with losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.\r\n\r\nThe son tested positive for COVID-19 on 10 March 2020, was asymptomatic at that time and sent home into quarantine.

Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in culture. Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae. Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nTo describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\r\nStudy Design\r\n\r\nWe describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nAmong 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient died","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","country_treated":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"30 3/7 weeks’ gestation","pregnant":true,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"A 25- to 29-year-old previously healthy gravida at 30 3/7 weeks’ gestation was seen in the outpatient antenatal clinic the day before admission with a complaint of sore throat and rhinorrhea with dry cough, but she was afebrile and did not have dyspnea. She was admitted the next day after becoming febrile (39°C) and experiencing shortness of breath and was normotensive (125/80 mm Hg). On the day of admission, chest CT had features of viral pneumonia, laboratory values were significant for lymphopenia and pancytopenia, and antepartum testing for fetal well-being was reassuring. The SARS-CoV-2 testing was done, but her test results were not positive until the day of death. Nonetheless, she was initiated on oseltamivir, azithromycin, and ceftazidime at the time of admission. She experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 24 hours later and was transferred to the ICU and intubated; linezolid and amantadine were added. Later that evening, onset of spontaneous labor accompanied persistent oxygen desaturations (SaO2 88% on ventilator support), with spontaneous vaginal delivery of an intrauterine fetal death (IUFD, stillbirth) the following morning. With persistent postpartum ARDS (SaO2 85%–90% on maximal ventilator support), meropenem, vancomycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir were added. She experienced acute hypotension and bradycardia 8 hours later and died despite cardiopulmonary resuscitative efforts. There are 3 other household members in her familial cohort: her son was diagnosed as having mild COVID-19 by clinical symptoms, and her father and husband had prolonged exposure. He recovered, and all are alive and well.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[5831,6122,6667,8745,8783,9463]},{"id":5812,"regimens":[{"id":10825,"duration":{"id":4882,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9463,"name":"Oseltamivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9463","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7016,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10825},{"id":7017,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10825}],"created":"2020-09-08T15:44:25.148472Z","updated":"2020-09-08T15:57:08.200927Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5812},{"id":10826,"duration":{"id":4883,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7018,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10826},{"id":7019,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10826}],"created":"2020-09-08T15:44:25.157341Z","updated":"2020-09-08T15:57:08.208722Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5812},{"id":10827,"duration":{"id":4884,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6675,"name":"Ceftriaxone","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6675","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7020,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":10827},{"id":7021,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":10827}],"created":"2020-09-08T15:44:25.164093Z","updated":"2020-09-08T15:57:08.215072Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"Inpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5812}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":12880,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5812},{"id":12881,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5812},{"id":12882,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5812}],"author_username":"Parvesh Paul","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.","author_country":"India","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3728,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5812}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":137,"answer":"Other","answer_other":"Middle eastern"}],"created":"2020-09-08T15:43:11.099543Z","updated":"2020-09-08T15:57:08.192089Z","title":"Maternal death due to COVID-19.

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila.          \r\n        Case presentation:      \r\n              Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. \r\nInfluenza B\r\n, human coronavirus 229E, \r\nStaphylococcus aureus\r\n and \r\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\r\n were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. \r\nInfluenza B\r\n and \r\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\r\n were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient's condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines.

In this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time. We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides.

There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              When the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS-CoV-2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms that could be a manifestation of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions. Both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, and anorexia and associated with elevation of CRP and ferritin, but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              Our report suggests that XLA patients might present with high risk to develop pneumonia after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but can recover from infection, suggesting that B-cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease. However, there is a need for larger observational studies to extend these conclusions to other patients with similar genetic immune defects.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"21-30 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Agammaglobulinemia - regular intravenous immunoglobulin infusions every 28 days and stayed in good health","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,6675,8342,8412]},{"id":5930,"regimens":[{"id":11095,"duration":{"id":5154,"approximate_duration":"10 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7450,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11095}],"created":"2020-09-16T10:56:28.239782Z","updated":"2020-09-17T10:50:52.732063Z","dose":"250 mg","frequency":"BID","route":"","severity":"Outpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5930},{"id":11096,"duration":{"id":5155,"approximate_duration":"8 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7451,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11096}],"created":"2020-09-16T10:56:28.247263Z","updated":"2020-09-17T10:50:52.738287Z","dose":"200 mg","frequency":"TID","route":"","severity":"Outpatient","severity_detail":"Patient started with a loading dose of 400 mg BID for 2 days","comments":null,"report":5930},{"id":11097,"duration":{"id":5156,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9337,"name":"Nitazoxanide","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9337","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7452,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11097}],"created":"2020-09-16T10:56:28.253404Z","updated":"2020-09-17T10:50:52.743898Z","dose":"500mg","frequency":"BID","route":"PO","severity":"Outpatient","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":5930}],"site_of_infection":[{"id":87,"answer":"lungs","report":5930}],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[{"id":7758,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5930}],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13214,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":5930},{"id":13215,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":5930},{"id":13216,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":5930}],"author_username":"Eleanor McCartney","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3871,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":5930}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":225,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-16T10:54:08.944895Z","updated":"2020-09-17T10:50:52.723914Z","title":"Efficacy of glutathione therapy in relieving dyspnea associated with COVID-19 pneumonia: A report of 2 cases.

Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm. Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions. We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19.          \r\n        Materials and methods:      \r\n              Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.          \r\n        Conclusions:      \r\n              Preliminary observations and a strong scientific foundation suggest that nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; cytokine storm; neuromodulation; non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation; respiratory symptoms.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"China","country_treated":"China","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"seasonal allergies, sleep apnea, and hypercholesterolemia and ongoing use of a continuous positive airway pressure device for sleep apnea for 15 years","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Respiratory tract infection","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Ongoing medications at hospital admission included ramipril (10 mg/d, for hypertension), metformin (2000 mg/d, for diabetes), glipizide (10 mg/d, for diabetes), and atorvastatin (40 mg/d for hypercholesterolemia). \r\n\r\nHe was provided supplemental oxygen (2 L via nasal cannula) but reported that he repeatedly stopped using it, owing to nasal dryness and epistaxis.

She was started on intravenous azithromycin on March 18. The decision was made to start hydroxychloroquine on March 21; however, it was stopped after 1 dose owing to a QTc of 620 ms with a notched broad T wave. No ventricular ectopy was present. Serum potassium and magnesium were 4.4 mM and 2.9 mg/dL, respectively. Electrophysiology consultation recommended 100 mg intravenous lidocaine followed by a repeat 12-lead electrocardiogram. This revealed a shortening of the QTc to 550 ms. It was recommended to restart hydroxychloroquine and begin a lidocaine infusion. The patient was able to complete the course of hydroxychloroquine without an arrhythmic event. Despite receiving a full course of hydroxychloroquine, she remained ventilator dependent and died owing to progressive metabolic acidosis and multiorgan system failure on March 25. By the time hydroxychloroquine was first initiated, she had already been intubated for 72 hours and was in severe respiratory failure.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342]},{"id":6000,"regimens":[{"id":11279,"duration":{"id":5334,"approximate_duration":"10 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":11301,"name":"Remdesivir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/11301","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7749,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11279}],"created":"2020-09-21T02:15:20.363637Z","updated":"2020-09-21T02:28:14.451824Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6000},{"id":11280,"duration":{"id":5335,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":10776,"name":"Tocilizumab","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/10776","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7750,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11280},{"id":7751,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11280}],"created":"2020-09-21T02:15:20.371488Z","updated":"2020-09-21T02:28:14.458277Z","dose":"400 mg","frequency":"one-time dose","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6000},{"id":11281,"duration":{"id":5336,"approximate_duration":"5 days","dates_unknown":true},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7752,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11281},{"id":7753,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11281}],"created":"2020-09-21T02:15:20.377950Z","updated":"2020-09-21T02:28:14.464145Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6000}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13387,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6000},{"id":13388,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6000},{"id":13389,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6000}],"author_username":"Reema Charles","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Improved","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3954,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6000}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"}],"races":[{"id":271,"answer":"American Indian or Alaskan Native","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-21T02:13:46.697116Z","updated":"2020-09-21T02:28:14.444046Z","title":"Visualization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 invading the human placenta using electron microscopy","status":"Approved","anonymous":false,"published":true,"pubmed_id":32405074,"doi":"10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.023","article_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219376/","pub_year":2020,"published_authors":"Gabriela N Algarroba, Patricia Rekawek, Sevan A Vahanian, et al","article_author_email":"Author email could not be found.","journal":"","abstract":"A 40-year-old Hispanic woman, G3P2002, at 28 weeks and 4 days of gestation, with no significant medical history, presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath, cough, and hypoxia in the setting of a known COVID-19 infection, on day 2 of 5 of an azithromycin course.

The first reported case happened in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. At present, at least 1.8 million people are infected around the world and almost 110,000 people have died. Many studies have analyzed the clinical picture of COVID-19, but they are focused on respiratory symptoms and headache is generically treated.          \r\n        \r\nMethods:      \r\nI describe and discuss my headaches during my COVID-19 and I review the MEDLINE literature about headaches and COVID-19.          \r\n        \r\nResults:      \r\nMore than 41,000 COVID-19 patients have been included in clinical studies and headache was present in 8%-12% of them. However, no headache characterization was made in these studies. As a headache expert and based on my own personal clinical case, headaches related to COVID-19 can be classified in the 2 phases of the disease. Acute headache attributed to systemic viral infection, primary cough headache, tension-type headache and headache attributed to heterophoria can appear in the first phase (the influenza-like phase); and headache attributed to hypoxia and a new headache, difficult to fit into the ICHD3, can appear if the second phase (the cytokine storm phase) occurs.          \r\n        \r\nConclusions:      \r\nSeveral headaches can appear during COVID-19 infection. All of them are headaches specified in the ICHD3, except 1 that occurs from the 7th day after the clinical onset. This headache is probably related to the cytokine storm that some patients suffer and it could be framed under the ICHD3 headache of Headache attributed to other non-infectious inflammatory intracranial disease. Although the reported prevalence of headaches as a symptom of COVID-19 infection is low, this experience shows that, very probably, it is underestimated.          \r\n        \r\nKeywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-12; coronavirus; cytokine storm; headache.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, systemic","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, Headaches, Hypoxia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"Acetaminophen","unusual":"Patient was a physician (neurologist specializing in headaches) and detailed the types of headaches he experienced at different stages of the infection.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"14 days","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"I was admitted to the hospital and started treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus oxygen therapy by means of a nasal catheter at 3 L/min.

Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID-19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36-year-old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID-19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug-to-drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO-incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course.

(COVID-19) was initially characterized by fever, sore throat, cough, and dyspnea, mainly manifestations of respiratory system. However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11%-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients were new-onset, moderate-severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6%-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV-2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n

After administration of SC tocilizumab, fever disappeared, and lung function progressively improved, with reduction of oxygen support and positioning of nasal oxygen flow with 4 l/min.","previously_treated":"","flagged":false,"other_coinfections":"","disease":630,"drugs":[6122,8342,9780,10776]},{"id":6022,"regimens":[{"id":11330,"duration":{"id":5385,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8342,"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8342","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7831,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11330},{"id":7832,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11330}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:25:27.920526Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.243313Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6022},{"id":11331,"duration":{"id":5386,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":6122,"name":"Azithromycin","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/6122","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7833,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11331},{"id":7834,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11331}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:25:27.928038Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.249908Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6022},{"id":11332,"duration":{"id":5387,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":8783,"name":"Lopinavir-Ritonavir","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/8783","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7835,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11332},{"id":7836,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11332}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:25:27.934280Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.255847Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6022},{"id":11333,"duration":{"id":5388,"approximate_duration":null,"dates_unknown":false},"drug":{"id":9780,"name":"Piperacillin-Tazobactam","url":"cure-api2.ncats.io/v1/drugs/9780","rxNorm_id":null,"notes":null},"use_drug":[{"id":7837,"answer":"To treat a disease other than the one for which the drug is approved","answer_other":"","regimen":11333},{"id":7838,"answer":"In a novel combination with another drug","answer_other":"","regimen":11333}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:25:27.940347Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.261556Z","dose":"","frequency":"","route":"","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","severity_detail":"","comments":null,"report":6022}],"site_of_infection":[],"specific_site":[],"how_outcome":[],"how_diagnosis":[{"id":13449,"answer":"Clinical assessment","answer_other":"","report":6022},{"id":13450,"answer":"Imaging","answer_other":"","report":6022},{"id":13451,"answer":"PCR","answer_other":"","report":6022}],"author_username":"Reema Charles","resistant_drugs":[],"combo_drugs":[],"organisms":[{"id":1887,"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)"}],"disease_name":"COVID-19","author_qualification":"Medical Doctor","author_affiliation":"None","author_country":"","outcome_computed":"Deteriorated","previous_drugs":[],"comments":[],"article_language":"English","why_new_way":[{"id":3988,"answer":"There is no standard/approved therapy for this disease","answer_other":"","report":6022},{"id":3989,"answer":"Co-Infection or Complex Co-morbidities","answer_other":"","report":6022}],"adverse_event_outcome":[],"is_author":false,"cross_linked_diseases":[{"id":396,"name":"Pneumonia"},{"id":550,"name":"Respiratory Tract Infections"},{"id":373,"name":"Tuberculosis"}],"races":[{"id":290,"answer":"White","answer_other":""}],"created":"2020-09-21T18:22:10.404149Z","updated":"2020-09-21T18:34:45.234728Z","title":"Tuberculosis, COVID-19 and migrants: Preliminary analysis of deaths occurring in 69 patients from two cohorts.

The aim of this study is to describe a group of patients who died with TB (active disease or sequelae) and COVID-19 in two cohorts. Data from 49 consecutive cases in 8 countries (cohort A) and 20 hospitalised patients with TB and COVID-19 (cohort B) were analysed and patients who died were described. Demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB and COVID-19 mortality. Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B. Migrants: (1) were younger than natives; in cohort A the median (IQR) age was 40 (27-49) VS. 66 (46-70) years, whereas in cohort B 37 (27-46) VS. 48 (47-60) years; (2) had a lower mortality rate than natives (1/43, 2.3% versus 7/26, 26.9%; p-value: 0.002); (3) had fewer co-morbidities than natives (23/43, 53.5% versus 5/26-19.2%) natives; p-value: 0.005). The study findings show that: (1) mortality is likely to occur in elderly patients with co-morbidities; (2) TB might not be a major determinant of mortality and (3) migrants had lower mortality, probably because of their younger age and lower number of co-morbidities. However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.          \r\n

After excluding malaria and dengue, which are common causative agents of acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) in Thailand, chest radiography was performed according to the patient triage protocol of our institute for AUFI during the COVID-19 outbreak. Chest radiography revealed findings compatible with pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal, throat, and sputum samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. The preadmission diagnosis of COVID-19 in this patient enabled appropriate management and isolation to prevent nosocomial transmission. Fever and nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results in early COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from tropical infectious diseases, especially when respiratory signs and symptoms are absent.

Case reports and case series depicting the clinical effects of the causative virus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-have been published, yet few demonstrate the cytopathologic alterations of this disease. We present a clinical-pathologic correlation report of a previously healthy Hispanic woman with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had typical features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and also showed cardiac abnormalities thought to represent fulminant viral myocarditis. Congruent with the ARDS clinical impression, autopsy findings were remarkable for extensive and markedly severe acute lung injury consistent with viral pneumonia, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary infarction, severe pulmonary edema, desquamation of pneumocytes with intra-alveolar aggregation, and pneumocyte morphologic alterations suggestive of viral cytopathic effect. However, there was incongruence between the clinical impression and the cardiovascular pathology findings in that viral myocarditis was not detected on histopathologic evaluation. This case highlights the importance of pathologic corroboration of the clinical impression and, in addition, illuminates the key role autopsy plays during a pandemic by providing valuable insight into viral pathology in tissues.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient

At first, it was thought that the patients who use immunmodulator therapy could be even at higher risks of disease complications.

December 2019, in Wuhan, China. As of today, 3 April 2020, 972,640 people affected and 50,325 people died from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2. There is not any standard treatment for coronavirus infection 2019; however, there are promising data for hydroxychloroquine and some anti-retroviral drugs. Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) pathway is an important target for the cancer immunotherapy. However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections. Thus, blockade of this pathway may lead to an anti-viral effect and decrease viral load. Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma. In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding. We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.

Case 1: A 46-year-old-man with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 infection was being administered favipiravir. Fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium were also given. On day 3, midazolam administration was initiated for deep sedation. On day 5, his high body temperature increased to 41.2 °C, creatine kinase level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS was suspected, and supportive therapy was initiated. High-grade fever persisted for 4 days and subsided on day 9. Case 2: A 44-year-old-man with ARDS caused by COVID-19 infection was being treated with favipiravir. On day 5, risperidone was started for delirium. On day 7, his body temperature suddenly increased to 40.8 °C, his CK level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS diagnosis was confirmed, and both, favipiravir and risperidone were discontinued on day 8. On the same day, his CK levels decreased, and his body temperature normalized on day 9. Patients with COVID-19 infection frequently require deep sedation and develop delirium; therefore, more attention should be paid to the development of NMS in patients who are being administered such causative agents. The mechanism underlying the occurrence of NMS in COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir remains unknown. Therefore, careful consideration of NMS development is necessary in the management of COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; Fever; Neuroleptic malignant syndrome.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"lungs","clinical_syndrome":"acute respiratory distress syndrome","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"This patient was receiving mechanical ventilation and was administered methylprednisolone (1g QD for 3 days).

On HD #3, his D-dimer was > 10,000 ng/mL (from 501 ng/mL on admission). A heparin infusion was started empirically and titrated to an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.5 IU/mL. With the exception of four anti-Xa levels that were slightly supratherapeutic (0.55–0.73 IU/mL), the level remained within the target range. On HD #5, he was enrolled in a clinical trial and was given sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody, or placebo. His subsequent hospital course was complicated by hypotension with increasing vasopressor requirements and acute kidney injury necessitating initiation of dialysis on HD #10.

The lack of high-quality research has translated to an absence of clarity at the bedside. With disease spread outpacing treatment consensus, provider discretion has taken on a heightened role. Here, we report a case of dexmedetomidine use in the setting of worsening hypoxemia, whereby oxygenation improved and intubation was avoided. Well known pharmacologic properties of the drug, namely the lack of respiratory depression and its anti-delirium effects, as well as other possible physiologic effects, suggest potential benefit for patients being managed with a delayed intubation approach. If dexmedetomidine can improve compliance with non-invasive oxygen support (the current recommended first-line therapy) while promoting better oxygenation, it may also decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and thus improve mortality.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"","clinical_syndrome":"","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Patient received the standard medical therapy endorsed by our department at the time of her care: supplemental oxygen, azithromycin, anticoagulation and corticosteroids.

Recent data supports SARS-CoV-2 may use integrins to enter human cells. Therefore, anti-integrins therapies might be an alternative against the infection . Natalizumab, approved for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treatment, acts blocking α4-integrin. We report a MS patient treated with natalizumab who develops COVID-19, with excellent recovery and repeated negative results in 5 consecutive microbiological studies.

However, taking into account the patient was asymptomatic and the risk of MS rebound associated to natalizumab discontinuation, natalizumab treatment was administered.\r\nOur patient had received natalizumab 48 h before symptoms onset, with the consequent block of α4integrin. If, as it has been proposed, SARS-CoV-2 may enter human cells through integrins, the blockade of these receptors by natalizumab may explain a low viral replication rate that could cause the repeated negative results for PCR for SARS-CoV-2, as well as a benign course of the disease. Patient had five SARS-CoV-2 swabs done, and only one returned positive, despite the symptoms the patient had.\r\n\r\nInitial negative serological results may be due to low production of antibodies associated with low viral replication or previous immunosuppression.

We found that COVID-19 related liver enzyme elevations occurred in a hepatocellular pattern and persisted throughout the initial hospitalization in all patients. Abnormalities in lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels were seen in all five cases. In conclusion, abnormalities in aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels are commonly seen in COVID-19 related liver injury. Elevated aminotransferase levels often persist throughout the entire hospitalization.

Its pathological effect is majorly in the respiratory tract, but its full pathogenicity remains a mystery. Symptoms associated with COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Some patients develop other symptoms like diarrhea. However, it is possible for other organs to be affected including the central nervous system, liver, and blood cells. The purpose of this case series is to unravel other factors associated with this disease, so we report three cases of COVID-19 that were hospitalized during the

Moreover, in this specific endemic situation, and according to the British Society of Thoracic Imaging expert reference group update, we took account of chest CT‐Scan results in the early detection of COVID‐19 pneumonia. Our 2 patients with a confirmed influenza SARS‐CoV‐2virus infection had respiratory distress with lung crackles on auscultation of one or both lungs and with alveolar pulmonary edema on the chest CT‐Scan. The cardiogenic nature of pulmonary edema was ruled out in both cases by a transthoracic echocardiography showing normal systolic and diastolic functions. Our patients were treated by oxygen via face mask in one case and mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment in the other patient.

Hip fracture patients represent a high-risk population for severe COVID-19 symptoms, as they are generally older with multiple medical comorbidities. There has been limited information available on the presenting characteristics and outcomes of COVID-positive patients with hip fractures who undergo surgical treatment.          \r\n        Methods:      \r\n              This was a retrospective study of 10 patients ≥60 years of age with a hip fracture and COVID-19 who underwent surgical treatment in New York City during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 1, 2020 to May 22, 2020. Clinical characteristics and early postoperative outcomes were reported.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Eight out of the 10 COVID-positive hip fracture patients in our series were asymptomatic on admission with no clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Only 2 patients presented with hypoxia. All 10 patients underwent surgery within 2 days of admission. Five out of the 10 patients - including the patients who presented with hypoxia - subsequently required supplemental oxygen postoperatively. Two patients had persistently elevated oxygen demands requiring prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond postoperative day 3. None of the patients were put on mechanical ventilation.

Herein, we present a simultaneous heart-kidney transplant (SHKT) recipient who was hospitalized for the management of respiratory failure from volume overload complicated by failure to thrive, multiple opportunistic infections, and open non-healing wounds in the setting of worsening renal dysfunction weeks prior to the first case of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in the state of Connecticut. After his third endotracheal intubation, routine nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2, in anticipation of a planned tracheostomy, was positive. His hemodynamics, respiratory status, and ventilator requirements remained stable without any worsening for 4 weeks until he had a negative NAT test. It is possible that the immunocompromised status of our patient may have prevented significant immune activation leading up to clinically significant cytokine storm that could have resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem organ failure.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; immunosuppression; simultaneous heart-kidney transplant.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":null,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":true,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Simultaneous heart-kidney transplant for underlying dilated cardiomyopathy from adriamycin treatment and chronic renal failure in January 2020,  acute tubular necrosis (ATN) without rejection after transplant","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"The perinephric collection\r\ngrew out vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and blood cultures revealed MRSA bacteremia.\r\nIn addition, he had developed a low-grade BK Polyoma virus DNAemia (768 copies/mL)\r\nInterestingly, his absolute lymphocyte count was measured to be 319 cells/μL (range: 850 - 3,900\r\ncells/μL), which was higher than 3 weeks prior (0 cells/μL).

A week before admission he felt bulging in his skin flap. Just after arrival to the hospital, he had a focal aware seizure that last for a few minutes before administration of 7.5 mg diazopam. Head CT showered severe brain swelling go the right temporal lobe. Chest CT revealed ground-glass opacities.

ventilation. While increased sputum secretion could cause airway obstruction during mechanical ventilation, there are few reported cases in the literature. We report a case of a 65-year-old man with diabetes and severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, nafamostat, and prone positioning. Initially, mechanical ventilation consisted of a heat moisture exchanger, endotracheal tube aspiration, and subglottic secretion drainage using a closed suction system. However, endotracheal tube impaction by highly viscous sputum occurred during this mechanical ventilation system. Replacing the endotracheal tube, the use of a humidifier instead of a heat moisture exchanger, and prone positioning contributed to the patient being weaned off mechanical ventilation. Although anti-aerosol measures are important for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, attention should be given to potential endotracheal tube impaction during mechanical ventilation.          \r\n        Keywords:      \r\n                  coronavirus 2019 (covid-19); coronavirus disease 2019; covid-19 respiratory failure high altitude pulmonary edema high flow nasal cannula acute respiratory distress syndrome; invasive mechanical ventilation; key words corona; sars cov-2; sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2); tube impaction.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia","severity":"ICU/Critical Care","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Continuation of mechanical ventilation proved difficult after endotracheal tube impaction with highly viscous sputum.

His visual acuity was severely impared on both eyes; he could only recognize waving hands and there was perception of light. His entire neurological examination was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral, especially left occipital, frontal cortical white matter and splenium of corpus callosum T2/Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities and diffusion restriction in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) revealing vasogenic edema similar to posterior reversible leucoencephalopathy (PRES).

However, some indeterminate symptoms that make diagnosis difficult, such as myalgia and fatigue, can also be seen alone, without the typical clinical picture. We describe a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia, the only complaint of which is myalgia, and the first diagnosis is mild rhabdomyolysis. The patient had no evidence or history other than viral infection that could explain muscle pain and also increased level of muscle enzymes. When mild rhabdomyolysis lack of myoglobinuria and complications was diagnosed, treatment-related rhabdomyolysis was also avoided as no treatment related to COVID-19 was initiated yet. Apart from the typical symptoms leading to the typical diagnosis of COVID-19 at the first admission, SARS-CoV-2 related with rhabdomyolysis should also be kept in mind.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"51-60 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Turkey","country_treated":"Turkey","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs, Skeletal Muscles","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, myalgia, fatigue, Rhabdomyolysis","severity":"Inpatient","prev_treatment":"","unusual":"Unusual disease manifestation-patient first presented with Rhabdomyolysis and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Routine blood test results were as follows: white blood cells, 2.91 × 109/L; neutrophils, 55.7%; lymphocytes, 30.2%; total number of lymphocytes, 0.88 × 109/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 35.1 mg/L; potassium, 4.3 mmol/L; sodium, 138 mmol/L; urea, 21 mg/dL; D-dimer, 210 ng/mL; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 52 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 117 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 575 U/L; ferritin, 428 ng/mL; international normalized ratio, 1.07; prothrombin time, 11 minutes; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dL; and direct bilirubin, 0.2 mg/dL.

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo. En todos los casos la radiografía de tórax era patológica con infiltrado unilateral o bilateral. La procalcitonina demostró no ser suficientemente sensible para detectar la infección neumocócica. La antibioterapia fue iniciada de manera precoz en los 5 casos con evolución satisfactoria.          \r\n        Conclusiones:      \r\n              Las guías internacionales no incluyen el cribado universal para coinfección bacteriana. El patrón radiológico del COVID-19 puede ser indistinguible de la neumonía neumocócica, y la frecuencia de la coinfección no ha sido establecida.

Sputum testing (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial computed tomography (CT) showed bipulmonary groundglass opacities and consolidations with peripheral distribution. Hospitalization with supportive therapy (azithromycin) as well as non-invasive oxygenation led to a stabilization of the patient. After 5 days, sputum testing was negative and IgA/IgG antibody titres were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was discharged after 7 days. On the 11th day, the patient realized pronounced dyspnoea after coughing and presented to the emergency department again.

A male in his 70s developed dysphagia and consequent aspiration pneumonia during recovery from severe COVID-19. He had altered sense of taste and absent gag reflex. Videoendoscopy, videofluorography, and high-resolution manometry revealed impaired pharyngolaryngeal sensation, silent aspiration, and mesopharyngeal contractile dysfunction. These findings suggested that glossopharyngeal and vagal neuropathy might have elicited dysphagia following COVID-19.

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado. En este trabajo describimos las características clínicas, el tratamiento y la evolución de los pacientes con coinfección por COVID-19 y neumococo.          \r\n        Pacientes y métodos:      \r\n              Todos los pacientes con COVID-19 que presentaron neumonía neumocócica durante marzo 2020 en un hospital universitario de Barcelona, España.          \r\n        Resultados:      \r\n              Cinco pacientes con COVID-19 confirmada por PCR o sospecha radiológica fueron diagnosticados de infección por neumococo.

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients.          \r\n        Patients and methods:      \r\n              Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution.          \r\n        Conclusion:      \r\n              International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.          \r\n        Introducción:      \r\n              En el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19 el riesgo de errores en el diagnóstico de otras causas de infección respiratoria es elevado.

COVID-19 may be associated with late presenting severe ITP. Such ITP may also be relatively resistant to first-line agents.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease that is more prevalent in the elderly population, the same group that are more susceptible to serious complications from COVID-19. Our literature search did not reveal any review about COVID-19 in IPF patients. We report a patient with IPF who was exposed to COVID-19 from her spouse and died from its complications.

throughout a patient's lifetime. Moreover, viral pathogens have been proven to be the leading contributors to myopericarditis in the pediatric and adult populations. Despite the current comprehensive knowledge of myocardial injury in viral and post-viral myopericarditis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced myopericarditis are poorly understood. This report presents a case of coronavirus (COVID-19) fulminant myopericarditis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a middle-aged male patient: a 50-SOME-old man with a history of hypertension who arrived to the emergency department with a dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and a fever. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, resulting in the patient's admission to the airborne isolation unit for clinical observation. When his condition began to deteriorate, the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit after electrocardiography detected cardiac injury, demonstrating diffuse ST-segment elevation.

at State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center following acute respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) viral pneumonia. The patient had significant comorbidities, including a history of lung and esophageal cancer status-post resection, cerebrovascular accident with neurological deficits, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient was in septic shock and respiratory failure on admission requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed patchy bilateral opacities suspicious for viral pneumonia and the COVID-19 sputum sample sent to the New York Department of Health returned positive. This patient's comorbidities, along with his age, placed him in the highest risk of mortality for COVID-19. The patient was managed pharmacologically with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. By Day 5 of his admission, he improved significantly and was extubated and downgraded from the ICU to the medical floor, pending discharge. This case report provides anecdotal evidence for the effectiveness of the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination currently being used across the nation to manage COVID-19, pending development of a definitive vaccine or antiviral treatment.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient

The World Health Organization later named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is no effective treatment available and the data are evolving through continuous clinical trials and ongoing research. Severe infections present with hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome as one of the major complications. We report two cases of COVID-19 patients who initially presented with moderate to severe symptoms. Later, their clinical course worsened despite ongoing treatment with multiple medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin until they were started on tocilizumab. Within a short period after they were administered tocilizumab, their oxygen saturation improved and other inflammatory markers such as D-dimer levels, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels decreased. There is an increase in the amount of research citing the role of various cytokines in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Targeting the inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis, especially interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, would improve overall morbidity and mortality, thus decreasing the burden on healthcare systems.

The World Health Organization later named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is no effective treatment available and the data are evolving through continuous clinical trials and ongoing research. Severe infections present with hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome as one of the major complications. We report two cases of COVID-19 patients who initially presented with moderate to severe symptoms. Later, their clinical course worsened despite ongoing treatment with multiple medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin until they were started on tocilizumab. Within a short period after they were administered tocilizumab, their oxygen saturation improved and other inflammatory markers such as D-dimer levels, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels decreased. There is an increase in the amount of research citing the role of various cytokines in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Targeting the inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis, especially interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, would improve overall morbidity and mortality, thus decreasing the burden on healthcare systems.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            covid 19; hypoxemic respiratory failure; inflammation; interleukin (il)-6; novel coronavirus; pathophysiology; pneumonia; sars-cov-2; tocilizumab.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":2,"article_patient_number":"2","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":true,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Atrial fibrillation on apixaban","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Bilateral airspace disease, cough, shortness of breath, fever","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"While the patient was still on treatment","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Within 24 hours of Tocilizumab treatment, her fevers started trending down, her oxygen saturation improved to mid-90s, and other inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein started trending down.

At present, an effective treatment regimen and vaccination has not been established. Many patients develop severe symptoms requiring endotracheal intubation and a prolonged stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In early postmortem examinations of COVID-19 patients, profuse viscous secretions were observed throughout the respiratory tract. Thus, oxygen supplementation without aggressive pulmonary hygiene management may be suboptimal. In the present case series, pulmonary hygiene management encompassed mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning. We report 3 severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in cruise ship employees who were admitted to the ICU and responded to supportive mechanical ventilation and pulmonary hygiene management. \r\n\r\nCASE REPORT Three cruise ship employees with COVID-19 underwent endotracheal intubation and were admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Initial chest X-rays suggested multifocal pneumonia with superimposed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A regimen of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and dexamethasone was initiated on admission in all cases. Additionally, medications used for pulmonary hygiene were administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in line with the ventilator circuit.

At present, an effective treatment regimen and vaccination has not been established. Many patients develop severe symptoms requiring endotracheal intubation and a prolonged stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In early postmortem examinations of COVID-19 patients, profuse viscous secretions were observed throughout the respiratory tract. Thus, oxygen supplementation without aggressive pulmonary hygiene management may be suboptimal. In the present case series, pulmonary hygiene management encompassed mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning. We report 3 severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in cruise ship employees who were admitted to the ICU and responded to supportive mechanical ventilation and pulmonary hygiene management. \r\n\r\nCASE REPORT Three cruise ship employees with COVID-19 underwent endotracheal intubation and were admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Initial chest X-rays suggested multifocal pneumonia with superimposed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A regimen of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and dexamethasone was initiated on admission in all cases. Additionally, medications used for pulmonary hygiene were administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in line with the ventilator circuit. Endotracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration. The duration from endotracheal intubation to extubation ranged from 9 to 24 days. All 3 patients reached 30-day survival. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS The cases reported highlight the importance of the use of airway hygiene with mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilatory support.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":3,"article_patient_number":"3","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"41-50 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"United States","country_treated":"United States","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia, fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, anxious, restless, dyspneic","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Tracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration.\r\n\r\nThroughout the remainder of the hospital course, the patient remained on nasal cannula with SpO2 ranging between 98–93%.

Some of them develop a systemic hyperinflammatory state produced by the massive release of inflammatory agents, known as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Inhibition of IL-1 by Anakinra (ANK) is a potential life-saving therapy for severe CSS cases. We propose a rationale for the use of subcutaneous ANK and review our initial experience in a small cohort of severe COVID-19 CSS patients.    \r\n          Methods:        \r\n            Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients developing ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and exhibiting signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >1000 ng/mL and/or d-dimers > 1.5 μg/mL, plus IL-6 < 40 mg/mL) that received ANK. For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome.    \r\n          Results:        \r\n            Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group. Favorable outcome was achieved in 55.6% and 88.9% of the ANK and TCZ cohorts, respectively (p = 0.281). Two patients that failed to respond to TCZ improved after ANK treatment. Aminotransferase levels significantly increased between day 1 and day 7 (p = 0.004) in the TCZ group. Mortality was the same in both groups (11%). There were not any opportunistic infection in the groups nor other adverse effects attributable to treatment.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Overall, 55.6% of COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients treated with ANK exhibited favorable outcome, not inferior to a TCZ treated matched cohort. ANK may be a potential alternative to TCZ for patients with elevated aminotransferases, and may be useful in non-responders to TCZ.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Anakinra; COVID-19; Cytokine storm syndrome; IL-1; SARS-CoV2; Tocilizumab.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":9,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Spain","country_treated":"Spain","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Days from disease onset to ANK treatment -

The patient was managed by the departments of vascular surgery, anesthesia and intensive care, and the Coagulation Service and Thrombosis Research from San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"Yes","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Italy","country_treated":"Italy","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"The patient was admitted to the Covid-19 ward and treated with noninvasive ventilation, ceftriaxone, and enoxaparin 6,000 anti-Xa IU once a day as antithrombotic prophylaxis. During the first 48 hr, the patient did not show any further clinical deterioration. However, from the third day after the admission, there was a progressive increase of the platelet count (443 × 109/L), D-dimer (3.73 μg/mL), C-reactive protein (229 mg/L), and worsening of the gas exchange. Consequently the patient was intubated and moved to the Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU).\r\n\r\nOn day 5, the patient suffered pain, numbness, and coldness of the right lower limb along with a massive augmentation of the D-dimer (>20 μg/mL). A Duplex ultrasound scan (DUS) showed complete occlusion of the right iliac and femoro-popliteal arteries, for which it performed an emergent revascularization of the lower limb under general anesthesia.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth post-op day, the patient presented a bilateral persistent acroischemia of the lower extremities, including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla, and dry gangrene.","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"2

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the clinical course and the therapeutic management of patients with chronic kidney disease and COVID-19 infection. To date, most evidence has come from renal transplantation, with about 45 patients reported thus far, and the current data from the ERA-EDTA (ERACODA) registry for transplanted patients and patients on Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT); as for those with glomerular diseases, data are lacking. Herein, we report the case of a 62-year-old patient with severe membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis who had been receiving a high burden of immunosuppression until four months before the COVID-19 infection. He developed severe disease with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. After treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, despite his low chances, he gradually recovered and survived. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few reported patients with glomerulonephritis who had COVID-19 Besides our single case with glomerulonephritis early during the disease outbreak, the very low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the country's transplant recipients (0.038%) and dialysis patients (0.24%) reflects the impact of the rapid implementation of social distancing rules as well as of preventive measures for disease control in the hospitals and dialysis units in our country.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":1,"article_patient_number":"","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient was cured/recovered","surgery":"No","age":"61-70 years","sex":"Male","ethnicity":null,"country_contracted":"Greece","country_treated":"Greece","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":false,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":false,"hypertension":false,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":true,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"After a period of follow-up","follow_up_period":"25 days after hospitalization","relapse":"No","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"Remdesivir was not administered because of renal impairment (peak creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL, corresponding to an eGFR of 23 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the CKD-EPI equation).
