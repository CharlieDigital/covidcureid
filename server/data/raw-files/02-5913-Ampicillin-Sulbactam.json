The clinical and laboratory data for these patients were extracted.          \r\n        Results:      \r\n              One patient in the 10-day group received RDV for only 5 days because of nausea and elevated liver transaminases. No patient had respiratory comorbidity. Seven patients had bilateral lesions and three had unilateral lesions on imaging. All patients had received other medications for COVID-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, before administration of RDV. Five patients required supplemental oxygen and one required mechanical ventilation. All patients showed clinical and laboratory evidence of improvement. Half of the patients developed elevated liver transaminases and three had nausea.

During hospitalization, another patient with no pulmonary shadows on admission developed pneumonia. In total, 11 (78.6%) of the 14 patients developed pneumonia, indicating its high prevalence in COVID-19. During hospitalization, the patients' symptoms spontaneously relapsed and resolved, and gastrointestinal symptoms were frequently found. C-reactive protein values showed correlation with the patients' clinical courses. Ritonavir/lopinavir were administered to 5 patients whose respiratory conditions worsened during admission, all of whom improved. However, the pneumonia in the 6 other patients improved without antivirals. None of the 14 patients died, whereas 5 other patients with cHCoV pneumonia were in respiratory failure on admission, and one patient (20%) died.    \r\n          Conclusion:        \r\n            Both SARS-CoV-2 and cHCoV can cause severe pneumonia. Problems for future resolution include whether antiviral agents administered in cases of mild or moderate severity can reduce the number of severe cases, and whether antivirals administered in severe cases can reduce mortality.    \r\n          Keywords:        \r\n            BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; BVBs, bronchovascular bundles; COVID-19; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CRP, C-reactive protein; CT, computed tomography; GGOs, ground-glass opacities; HFNC, high-flow nasal cannula; Novel coronavirus 2019; Pneumonia; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2; Wuhan; cHCoV, conventional human coronavirus.","article_type":"Original","study_type":"Case Report","number_of_patients":11,"article_patient_number":"1","full_text_available":true,"outcome":"Patient improved","surgery":"No","age":"81-89 years","sex":"Female","ethnicity":"Not Hispanic/Latino","country_contracted":"Japan","country_treated":"Japan","began_treatment_year":"2020","hiv":false,"asthma":true,"lung_disease":false,"diabetes_mellitus":true,"hypertension":true,"cardiovascular_disease":false,"chronic_renal_disease":false,"chronic_liver_disease":false,"immunosuppressant_drugs":false,"intellectual_disability":false,"smoker":false,"other_immunodeficiency":false,"other_comorbid":"","pregnant":false,"unknown":false,"site_of_disease":"Lungs","clinical_syndrome":"Pneumonia","severity":null,"prev_treatment":"","unusual":"","drug_treatment_features":"","have_adverse_events":false,"adverse_events":"","when_outcome":"At the time the treatment was completed","follow_up_period":null,"relapse":"Unknown","reminder":false,"when_reminder":"1 week","additional_info":"We performed another CT scan, which showed improvement of the shadows on admission, but new shadows had developed.
